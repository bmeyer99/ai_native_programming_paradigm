# Execution Model for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview

This document defines the execution model for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm, specifying how ANRF (AI-Native Representation Format) instances are executed, interpreted, or compiled. It details the interaction between execution, verification, security, developer tooling, and system services. This model is foundational for ensuring consistency, correctness, and performance across the paradigm.

---

## 1. Execution Modes

- **Interpretation**: ANRF instances are directly interpreted by the Execution Service, enabling rapid prototyping, debugging, and dynamic analysis.
- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation**: ANRF is compiled at runtime to an intermediate representation (e.g., WASM, Python bytecode) for improved performance.
- **Ahead-of-Time (AOT) Compilation**: For production, ANRF can be compiled to native code or a target platform binary, leveraging optimizations and static analysis.

## 2. Execution Service Architecture

- **API Endpoint**: `/execute/{anrfId}`
  - Input: Path parameter `anrfId`, body `{ "inputs": { ... } }`
  - Output: `{ "output": { ... }, "logs": [ "string" ], "executionId": "uuid" }` or `{ "error": "string" }`
- **Core Components**:
  - **ANRF Loader**: Fetches and validates the ANRF instance from the Registry.
  - **Input Validator**: Ensures runtime inputs conform to expected types and constraints.
  - **Interpreter/JIT Compiler**: Executes or compiles the ANRF instance.
  - **Sandbox Environment**: Isolates execution for security and resource control.
  - **Monitoring Agent**: Collects logs, metrics, and traces for observability.
  - **Security Guard**: Enforces runtime security policies (see Security Framework).
  - **Verifier Hook**: Optionally invokes verification before or after execution.

## 3. Execution Flow

1. **Request Received**: API Gateway routes execution request to Execution Service.
2. **ANRF Fetch & Validation**: Loader retrieves ANRF, checks integrity (signatures/checksums), and validates schema.
3. **Input Validation**: Inputs are checked against ANRF metadata/schema.
4. **Pre-Execution Verification (Optional)**: If configured, Verification Service is invoked to check ANRF correctness and security.
5. **Execution**: Interpreter or JIT executes the ANRF in a sandboxed environment.
6. **Monitoring & Logging**: All execution events, outputs, and errors are logged and sent to Monitoring Service.
7. **Post-Execution Verification (Optional)**: Verification Service may be invoked to check output properties or invariants.
8. **Result Return**: Output and logs are returned to the caller.

## 4. Security & Isolation

- **Sandboxing**: All execution occurs in isolated containers or VMs to prevent privilege escalation and resource abuse.
- **Resource Limits**: CPU, memory, and I/O quotas enforced per execution.
- **Access Control**: Execution requests require authentication and authorization via API Gateway.
- **Audit Logging**: All execution events are logged for traceability and forensics.
- **Runtime Policy Enforcement**: Security Guard enforces policies (e.g., no network access, restricted file I/O).

---

## 5. Integration Points

- **ANRF Registry**: Source of truth for executable artifacts.
- **Verification Service**: Ensures correctness and security before/after execution.
- **Monitoring Service**: Aggregates logs, metrics, and traces for observability and debugging.
- **Developer Tooling**: IDEs and CI/CD pipelines interact with Execution Service for testing and validation.
- **Security Framework**: Enforces runtime and post-execution security policies.

---

## 6. Extensibility & Future Directions

- **Pluggable Backends**: Support for multiple target platforms (WASM, JVM, native, etc.).
- **Adaptive Optimization**: Runtime profiling guides JIT/AOT optimization strategies.
- **Distributed Execution**: Support for parallel and distributed execution of ANRF instances.
- **Custom Hooks**: Allow user-defined pre/post-execution hooks for advanced workflows.

---

## 7. Open Questions & Cross-Specialist Dependencies

- **Representation Semantics**: Coordination with Language Designer to ensure execution semantics match ANRF specification.
- **AI Integration**: How AI-driven optimizations or dynamic code generation interact with runtime.
- **Verification Guarantees**: Theoretical Computer Scientist to validate soundness of runtime verification.
- **Developer Experience**: How execution feedback is surfaced in IDEs and CI/CD.
- **Tooling Integration**: Tool Ecosystem Engineer to ensure compatibility with debugging, profiling, and monitoring tools.
- **Implementation Strategy**: Rollout plan for interpretation, JIT, and AOT phases.
