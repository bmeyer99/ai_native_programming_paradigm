# Format Evolution for AI-Native Representation Format

## Overview

This document defines the mechanisms, principles, and strategies for evolving the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF) over time. As AI capabilities, hardware architectures, and software development practices evolve, the representation format must adapt while maintaining compatibility and semantic preservation. This document outlines how ANRF can evolve gracefully to incorporate new features, support new paradigms, and address emerging challenges.

## Core Principles

1. **Backward Compatibility**: New versions must maintain compatibility with existing ANRF representations
2. **Semantic Preservation**: Evolution must preserve semantic meaning across versions
3. **Extensibility**: The format must support extensions without breaking existing tools
4. **Versioning**: Clear versioning mechanisms must track and manage changes
5. **Migration Paths**: Well-defined paths must exist for migrating between versions

## Evolution Framework

The evolution framework consists of five main components:

### 1. Versioning System

The Versioning System tracks changes to the format:

- **Format Version**: The overall version of ANRF
- **Layer Versions**: Versions of individual layers (Execution, Semantic, Intent)
- **Feature Versions**: Versions of specific features within layers
- **Compatibility Matrix**: Compatibility between different versions

Version numbers follow Semantic Versioning (SemVer):
- **Major Version**: Incompatible changes
- **Minor Version**: Backward-compatible additions
- **Patch Version**: Backward-compatible fixes

### 2. Extension Mechanisms

Extension Mechanisms allow adding new capabilities without breaking existing ones:

- **Extension Points**: Well-defined points where extensions can be added
- **Extension Registry**: Registry of standard and custom extensions
- **Extension Negotiation**: Protocol for negotiating extension support
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Graceful degradation when extensions aren't supported

### 3. Migration Tools

Migration Tools facilitate upgrading between versions:

- **Automatic Upgraders**: Tools for automatically upgrading to new versions
- **Compatibility Layers**: Layers that provide compatibility with older versions
- **Format Converters**: Tools for converting between different formats
- **Validation Tools**: Tools for validating correctness of migrations

### 4. Governance Process

The Governance Process manages evolution decisions:

- **Change Proposals**: Process for proposing changes
- **Review Process**: Process for reviewing changes
- **Acceptance Criteria**: Criteria for accepting changes
- **Release Planning**: Planning for new releases

### 5. Evolution Strategy

The Evolution Strategy guides long-term evolution:

- **Roadmap**: Long-term vision for ANRF evolution
- **Deprecation Policy**: Policy for deprecating features
- **Experimental Features**: Process for introducing experimental features
- **Stability Guarantees**: Guarantees about stability of different components

## Version Management

### Version Specification

Each ANRF representation includes version information:

```json
{
  "anrf_version": "2.0.0",
  "layer_versions": {
    "execution": "2.1.0",
    "semantic": "2.0.1",
    "intent": "2.0.0"
  },
  "extensions": [
    {"name": "quantum_operations", "version": "1.0.0"},
    {"name": "probabilistic_reasoning", "version": "0.5.0", "experimental": true}
  ],
  "compatibility": {
    "min_tool_version": "1.5.0",
    "recommended_tool_version": "2.0.0"
  }
}
```

### Version Compatibility

Version compatibility is defined by compatibility rules:

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Newer tools can read older formats
2. **Forward Compatibility**: Older tools can read newer formats (with limitations)
3. **Feature Detection**: Tools can detect and adapt to available features
4. **Graceful Degradation**: Tools can function with reduced capabilities when needed

### Version Transitions

Version transitions follow a structured process:

1. **Proposal**: New features or changes are proposed
2. **Experimental Phase**: Features are implemented as experimental
3. **Stabilization**: Features are stabilized based on feedback
4. **Release**: Features are included in a new release
5. **Deprecation**: Old features are marked for deprecation
6. **Removal**: Deprecated features are removed after a transition period

## Extension Mechanisms

### Extension Types

ANRF supports several types of extensions:

1. **Layer Extensions**: Extensions to existing layers
2. **New Layers**: Entirely new layers
3. **Feature Extensions**: Extensions to existing features
4. **Tool Extensions**: Extensions for specific tools
5. **Domain Extensions**: Extensions for specific domains

### Extension Definition

Extensions are defined by extension specifications:

  "dependencies": [
    {"extension": "complex_numbers", "version": ">=1.0.0"}
  ],
  "schema": {

  },
  "semantics": {
    "operational": {...},
    "denotational": {...}
  },
  "compatibility": {
    "min_anrf_version": "2.0.0"

Extensions are registered in an extension registry:

1. **Standard Extensions**: Extensions that are part of the ANRF standard
2. **Vendor Extensions**: Extensions provided by specific vendors
3. **Domain Extensions**: Extensions for specific domains
4. **Experimental Extensions**: Extensions that are still experimental
