# Semantic Mapping in AI-Native Representation Format

## Overview

Semantic mapping is the process by which meaning is preserved in the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF) as code moves between different levels of abstraction and undergoes optimizations. This document defines the mechanisms, principles, and techniques used to ensure that the semantic intent of the original code is maintained throughout transformations.

## Core Principles

1. **Semantic Equivalence**: Transformations must preserve observable behavior as defined by the formal semantics
2. **Bidirectional Traceability**: Every element must be traceable to its semantic origins and vice versa
3. **Compositional Mapping**: Semantic mappings must compose predictably across transformations
4. **Explicit Representation**: Semantic relationships must be explicitly represented, not implicit
5. **Verifiability**: Semantic mappings must support formal verification of correctness

## Semantic Mapping Framework

The semantic mapping framework consists of four main components:

### 1. Semantic Entity Model

The Semantic Entity Model defines the core semantic entities and their relationships:

- **Entities**: The fundamental semantic units (variables, functions, types, etc.)
- **Properties**: The characteristics of entities (type, mutability, visibility, etc.)
- **Relationships**: The connections between entities (uses, defines, extends, etc.)
- **Behaviors**: The observable behaviors associated with entities

Each entity is assigned a unique semantic identifier that persists across transformations, enabling traceability.

### 2. Transformation Mappings

Transformation Mappings define how semantic entities are preserved across transformations:

- **Identity Mappings**: One-to-one mappings where an entity is preserved intact
- **Decomposition Mappings**: One-to-many mappings where an entity is split into multiple entities
- **Composition Mappings**: Many-to-one mappings where multiple entities are combined
- **Refinement Mappings**: Mappings where an abstract entity is refined to a more concrete form
- **Abstraction Mappings**: Mappings where a concrete entity is abstracted to a more general form

Each transformation mapping includes:
- Source entities
- Target entities
- Mapping type
- Semantic preservation conditions
- Verification hints

### 3. Semantic Preservation Conditions

Semantic Preservation Conditions are formal specifications that must be satisfied to ensure semantic equivalence:

- **Invariants**: Properties that must remain unchanged across transformations
- **Pre/Post-Conditions**: Conditions that must hold before and after transformations
- **Behavioral Equivalence**: Specifications of behavioral equivalence between source and target
- **Refinement Conditions**: Conditions for valid refinements of abstract entities

These conditions are expressed in a formal specification language that supports automated verification.

### 4. Verification Mechanisms

Verification Mechanisms are the techniques used to verify semantic preservation:

- **Static Analysis**: Compile-time analysis of semantic preservation
- **Formal Proofs**: Mathematical proofs of semantic equivalence
- **Property Testing**: Systematic testing of semantic properties
- **Runtime Assertions**: Dynamic checks of semantic conditions

## Semantic Mapping Layers

Semantic mapping occurs at multiple layers, corresponding to the three layers of ANRF:

### Intent to Semantic Mapping

Maps from the Intent Metadata Layer to the Semantic Mapping Layer:

- **Intent Capture**: Extracting semantic meaning from intent expressions
- **Constraint Mapping**: Translating intent constraints to semantic conditions
- **Rationale Preservation**: Maintaining design rationale in semantic form
- **Domain Knowledge Integration**: Incorporating domain knowledge into semantic entities

### Semantic to Execution Mapping

Maps from the Semantic Mapping Layer to the Execution Layer:

- **Type Mapping**: Translating semantic types to execution types
- **Operation Mapping**: Mapping semantic operations to execution instructions
- **Control Flow Mapping**: Preserving control flow semantics in execution
- **Memory Model Mapping**: Translating semantic memory model to execution memory model

## Semantic Mapping Techniques

The framework employs several key techniques for semantic mapping:

### 1. Semantic Annotations

Semantic annotations attach semantic information to code elements:

- **Type Annotations**: Detailed type information beyond execution requirements
- **Effect Annotations**: Information about computational effects
- **Contract Annotations**: Pre/post-conditions and invariants
- **Intent Annotations**: Descriptions of intended behavior

Example:
```
@type(List<@notnull Item>)
@effects(pure, deterministic)
@precondition(items.length > 0)
@postcondition(result >= 0)
@intent("Calculate total price with applicable discounts")
function calculateTotal(items) {
    // Implementation
}
```

### 2. Semantic Graphs

Semantic graphs represent the relationships between semantic entities:

- **Nodes**: Semantic entities
- **Edges**: Semantic relationships
- **Properties**: Semantic properties of entities and relationships
- **Subgraphs**: Grouped semantic entities that form logical units

The semantic graph is maintained alongside the code and updated with each transformation.

### 3. Transformation Records

Transformation records document how transformations affect semantic entities:

- **Transformation Type**: The kind of transformation applied
- **Source Entities**: The entities before transformation
- **Target Entities**: The entities after transformation
- **Preservation Evidence**: Evidence that semantic properties are preserved
- **Verification Status**: Whether the transformation has been verified

Example transformation record:
```json
{
  "id": "transform:123",
  "type": "loop_unrolling",
  "source": ["loop:for_each_item"],
  "target": ["seq:item1", "seq:item2", "seq:item3"],
  "preserves": ["behavior:total_calculation", "property:determinism"],
  "verification": {
    "status": "verified",
    "method": "static_analysis",
    "timestamp": "2025-04-01T10:30:00Z"
  }
}
```

### 4. Semantic Refinement Chains

Semantic refinement chains track the progressive refinement of semantic entities:

- **Abstract Entity**: The original, abstract semantic entity
- **Refinement Steps**: The sequence of refinements applied
- **Concrete Entity**: The final, concrete semantic entity
- **Refinement Conditions**: The conditions that ensure valid refinement

Refinement chains enable bidirectional traceability between abstract and concrete representations.

## Semantic Mapping Process

The semantic mapping process follows these steps:

### 1. Initial Semantic Capture

During code generation or import:
- Extract semantic entities from source
- Build initial semantic graph
- Establish semantic annotations
- Create baseline semantic model

### 2. Transformation Mapping

During code transformation:
- Identify affected semantic entities
- Determine appropriate mapping type
- Create transformation record
- Update semantic graph
- Verify semantic preservation

### 3. Semantic Verification

After transformation:
- Check invariant preservation
- Verify pre/post-conditions
- Confirm behavioral equivalence
- Validate refinement conditions
- Record verification results

### 4. Semantic Query and Navigation

For development tools and human interaction:
- Query semantic entities by properties
- Navigate semantic relationships
- Trace transformation history
- Explore semantic refinements

## Formal Semantic Mapping Model

The formal model of semantic mapping is defined as:

```
SM = (E, R, T, V)
```

Where:
- `E`: Set of semantic entities
- `R`: Set of semantic relationships
- `T`: Set of transformation mappings
- `V`: Set of verification conditions

### Semantic Entities

```
E = {e | e = (id, type, props, behavior)}
```

Where:
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `type`: Entity type
- `props`: Set of properties
- `behavior`: Formal behavior specification

### Semantic Relationships

```
R = {r | r = (source, target, type, props)}
```

Where:
- `source`: Source entity or set of entities
- `target`: Target entity or set of entities
- `type`: Relationship type
- `props`: Relationship properties

### Transformation Mappings

```
T = {t | t = (source, target, type, conditions)}
```

Where:
- `source`: Source entities
- `target`: Target entities
- `type`: Transformation type
- `conditions`: Semantic preservation conditions

### Verification Conditions

```
V = {v | v = (entity, condition, status)}
```

Where:
- `entity`: Entity or transformation
- `condition`: Formal condition
- `status`: Verification status

## Semantic Mapping Examples

### Example 1: Function Inlining

Original code:
```javascript
function discount(price) {
  return price * 0.9;
}

function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let item of items) {
    total += discount(item.price);
  }
  return total;
}
```

After inlining:
```javascript
function calculateTotal(items) {
  let total = 0;
  for (let item of items) {
    total += item.price * 0.9;
  }
  return total;
}
```

Semantic mapping:
```json
{
  "transformation": "function_inlining",
  "source": ["func:discount", "func:calculateTotal"],
  "target": ["func:calculateTotal_v2"],
  "mapping": {
    "type": "composition",
    "entities": {
      "func:discount": {
        "mapped_to": "expr:price_times_0.9",
        "in_context": "func:calculateTotal_v2"
      },
      "func:calculateTotal": {
        "mapped_to": "func:calculateTotal_v2",
        "with_changes": ["inlined:discount"]
      }
    }
  },
  "preservation": {
    "behavior:calculate_discounted_total": "preserved",
    "property:determinism": "preserved",
    "property:purity": "preserved"
  }
}
```

### Example 2: Loop Optimization

Original code:
```javascript
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  return sum;
}
```

After optimization:
```javascript
function sumArray(array) {
  let sum = 0;
  let len = array.length;
  let i = 0;
  
  // Handle blocks of 4 elements
  for (; i + 3 < len; i += 4) {
    sum += array[i] + array[i+1] + array[i+2] + array[i+3];
  }
  
  // Handle remaining elements
  for (; i < len; i++) {
    sum += array[i];
  }
  
  return sum;
}
```

Semantic mapping:
```json
{
  "transformation": "loop_unrolling",
  "source": ["loop:for_i"],
  "target": ["loop:for_blocks", "loop:for_remainder"],
  "mapping": {
    "type": "decomposition",
    "entities": {
      "loop:for_i": {
        "mapped_to": ["loop:for_blocks", "loop:for_remainder"],
        "decomposition_strategy": "block_processing"
      }
    }
  },
  "preservation": {
    "behavior:sum_all_elements": "preserved",
    "property:determinism": "preserved",
    "property:complexity": "improved",
    "invariant:processes_all_elements": "preserved"
  }
}
```

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Semantic Drift

**Problem**: Accumulated transformations can lead to semantic drift where the final code no longer accurately reflects the original intent.

**Solution**:
- Explicit semantic invariants that must be preserved
- Compositional verification of transformation chains
- Periodic semantic reconciliation to detect drift
- Semantic version control to track changes over time

### Challenge 2: Ambiguous Mappings

**Problem**: Some transformations may have ambiguous semantic mappings where multiple interpretations are possible.

**Solution**:
- Explicit disambiguation annotations
- Preference ranking for mapping strategies
- Context-sensitive mapping rules
- Human-in-the-loop resolution for critical ambiguities

### Challenge 3: Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Problem**: Some semantic properties span multiple code elements and are difficult to track through transformations.

**Solution**:
- Aspect-oriented semantic annotations
- Global semantic constraints
- Cross-entity semantic relationships
- Whole-program semantic analysis

### Challenge 4: Verification Complexity

**Problem**: Formal verification of semantic preservation can be computationally expensive or undecidable.

**Solution**:
- Tiered verification approach (critical vs. non-critical properties)
- Incremental verification for local changes
- Verification hints to guide automated provers
- Hybrid verification combining formal methods and testing

## Integration with ANRF Layers

The semantic mapping framework integrates with the three layers of ANRF:

### Intent Metadata Layer Integration

- Intent annotations are translated to formal semantic properties
- Design rationale is captured in semantic relationship explanations
- Domain constraints become semantic invariants
- Natural language descriptions are linked to semantic entities

### Semantic Mapping Layer Integration

- Semantic entities form the core of the Semantic Mapping Layer
- Semantic relationships define the structure of the semantic graph
- Transformation mappings track changes within the layer
- Verification conditions ensure consistency within the layer

### Execution Layer Integration

- Execution nodes are linked to semantic entities
- Execution edges correspond to semantic relationships
- Execution properties are derived from semantic properties
- Execution behavior is constrained by semantic specifications

## Conclusion

Semantic mapping is the critical mechanism that ensures the AI-Native Representation Format maintains meaning across transformations. By explicitly representing semantic entities, relationships, and transformations, ANRF enables powerful optimizations while preserving the connection to human intent and supporting formal verification of correctness.
