# Semantic Foundations for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Based on Initial Formal Model (2025-04-06)

### Core Semantic Functions:

- **Intent Semantics (`Sem_I: I -> P(M -> Obs)`):**
    - Maps an Intent `i` to a *set* of acceptable behaviors.
    - Captures the desired functionality, potentially allowing for underspecification or multiple valid implementations.
    - Formalizing `I` and `Sem_I` is a key challenge, potentially involving logic, temporal logic, or relational specifications.

- **Representation Semantics (`Sem_R: R -> (M -> Obs)`):**
    - Maps a Representation `r` to a *specific* behavior.
    - Defines the precise meaning of the canonical code form (`R`).
    - Likely candidates: Operational Semantics (small-step or big-step) for machine code/IR, potentially Denotational Semantics for higher-level reasoning.
    - Must be rigorously defined to serve as the basis for verification (equivalence `≈`).
    - Needs to account for machine state/context (`M`).

- **Human-Readable View Semantics (`Sem_H: H -> P(M -> Obs)`):**
    - Defines the meaning of the generated human-readable views.
    - The relationship between `Sem_H(View(r))` and `Sem_R(r)` defines "Viewing Faithfulness". This might involve abstraction mappings or equivalence w.r.t. certain properties.

### Key Semantic Concepts:

- **Meaning Preservation:** The core requirement for optimization (`Opt`) is that it preserves `Sem_R` (i.e., `Opt(r) ≈ r`).
- **Refinement:** The core requirement for generation (`Gen`) is that `Sem_R(r)` is a valid implementation of `Sem_I(i)` (i.e., `r ⊑ i`).
- **Compositionality:** The semantics must define how representations compose (`Sem_R(compose(r1, r2))`) based on `Sem_R(r1)` and `Sem_R(r2)`.
- **Context Dependence:** Semantics must be parameterized by the execution context/machine state (`M`).

### Challenges:

- **Defining `Sem_R`:** Requires choosing an appropriate semantic style (operational, denotational, axiomatic) and formalizing it for the specific Representation `R` (which is yet to be fully defined). Needs to handle low-level details (memory, concurrency).
- **Defining `Sem_I`:** Formalizing potentially vague human intent is difficult.
- **Bridging `Sem_I` and `Sem_R`:** Establishing the refinement relation (`⊑`) across different levels of abstraction.
- **Defining `Sem_H` and Faithfulness:** Formalizing the relationship between the optimized code and its human-readable views.

## Status:
- High-level semantic functions identified (2025-04-06).
- Choice of specific semantic styles (operational, denotational) depends on the definition of `R`.
- Formalization of `Sem_I` and the `View` faithfulness relation are major open research areas.
