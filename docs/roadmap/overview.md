# Project Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development plan for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm project. It is divided into six major phases, each with specific objectives and milestones.

## Roadmap Overview

1. **Foundation and Research**: Establishing the theoretical framework and proof-of-concept
2. **Core Technology Development**: Building fundamental components
3. **Development Tooling**: Creating necessary tools for practical development
4. **Integration and Interoperability**: Ensuring compatibility with existing systems
5. **Scaling and Optimization**: Preparing for production use
6. **Ecosystem Growth**: Building community and standards

## Current Status
