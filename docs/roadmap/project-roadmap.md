## Dependencies

### Critical Path
1. Formal Framework → ANRF Design → Technical Architecture → Implementation Planning → Internal Dogfooding

### Key Dependencies for Phase 1 (Internal Dogfooding)
- Core ANRF implementation depends on ANRF specification (Language Designer)
- Basic AI models depend on AI capability roadmap (AI Integration Specialist)
- IDE plugin development depends on tooling implementation plan (Tool Ecosystem Engineer)
- UX implementation depends on visualization and interaction designs (Developer Experience Designer)
- Core team onboarding depends on adoption strategy (Implementation Strategist)

## Risk Management

### Key Risks
1. **Technical Complexity**: The integration of multiple advanced components may introduce unexpected challenges.
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with internal testing before wider release.

2. **Developer Adoption**: Resistance to new paradigm due to learning curve or skepticism.
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive change management and training approach.

3. **AI Capability Limitations**: Current AI models may not meet all requirements.
   - Mitigation: Tiered approach with progressive enhancement as AI capabilities improve.

4. **Integration Challenges**: Connecting with existing development ecosystems may be complex.
   - Mitigation: Focus on interoperability and migration paths from traditional approaches.

## Next Steps (Immediate)
1. Initiate detailed planning for Phase 1 (Internal Dogfooding) implementation
2. Assign specific development tasks to specialist teams
3. Establish development timeline and milestones for Phase 1
4. Select core team members for Internal Dogfooding
5. Begin development of core platform components
