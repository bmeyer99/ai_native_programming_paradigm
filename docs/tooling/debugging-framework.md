# Debugging Framework for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview

This document outlines the design for debugging tools to support the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF). The goal is to provide developers with the necessary tools to debug code represented in ANRF, spanning multiple layers (IML, SML, EL), and leveraging AI capabilities to assist in the debugging process.

## Key Debugging Features

1. **Multi-Layer Debugging**: Support for debugging across IML, SML, and EL layers.
2. **AI-Assisted Debugging**: Use AI to explain execution traces, identify root causes, and suggest fixes.
3. **Visualization Tools**: Provide visual representations of control flow, data flow, and semantic relationships.
4. **Interactive Debugging**: Allow developers to interactively step through code, inspect variables, and modify execution.

## Multi-Layer Debugging

### Layer-Specific Debugging

1. **IML Debugging**: Debugging high-level intent and design rationale.
    * Features: Breakpoints on intent statements, inspection of design rationale, tracking of intent fulfillment.
2. **SML Debugging**: Debugging semantic relationships and transformations.
    * Features: Breakpoints on semantic entities, inspection of relationships and contracts, tracking of transformations.
3. **EL Debugging**: Debugging execution-level code.
    * Features: Traditional debugging features (breakpoints, step-through, variable inspection) adapted for ANRF.

### Cross-Layer Debugging

* **Cross-Layer Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints that trigger across multiple layers (e.g., when a high-level intent is executed in EL).
* **Cross-Layer Tracing**: Trace the execution flow across IML, SML, and EL, showing how high-level intents are realized in execution.
* **Cross-Layer Variable Inspection**: Inspect variables and their transformations across layers.

## AI-Assisted Debugging

### AI Capabilities

1. **Execution Trace Explanation**: Use AI to generate natural language explanations of execution traces, highlighting key steps and decisions.
    * Input: Execution trace (EL)
    * Output: Explanation (text, diagram)
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Use AI to analyze execution traces and identify potential root causes of issues.
    * Input: Execution trace (EL), error/issue description
    * Output: Root cause analysis (text, diagram)
3. **Fix Suggestions**: Use AI to suggest potential fixes for identified issues.
    * Input: Root cause analysis
    * Output: Suggested fixes (code snippets, transformations)

### Integration with IDE

* **AI Debugging Assistant**: An IDE plugin that provides AI-assisted debugging features, including trace explanations, root cause analysis, and fix suggestions.
* **Interactive Debugging Console**: An interactive console within the IDE that allows developers to query the AI for explanations, analyses, and suggestions.

## Visualization Tools

### Control Flow Visualization

* **Control Flow Graphs**: Visual representations of control flow within ANRF, showing the flow of execution across EL, SML, and IML.
* **Execution Path Highlighting**: Highlight the execution path taken during debugging, showing the flow of control across layers.

### Data Flow Visualization

* **Data Flow Graphs**: Visual representations of data flow within ANRF, showing how data is transformed and propagated across EL, SML, and IML.
* **Variable Tracking**: Track the flow and transformation of variables across layers, showing their values at different points in the execution.

### Semantic Relationship Visualization

* **Entity Maps**: Visual representations of semantic entities and their relationships within SML.
* **Transformation History**: Visual representations of the transformation history of semantic entities, showing how they evolve over time.

## Interactive Debugging

### Step-Through Debugging

* **Step Into/Over/Out**: Traditional step-through debugging features, adapted for ANRF.
* **Layer-Specific Stepping**: Step through code at different layers (IML, SML, EL), with the ability to switch layers during debugging.

### Variable Inspection and Modification

* **Variable Inspection**: Inspect the values of variables at different points in the execution, across layers.
* **Variable Modification**: Modify the values of variables during debugging, with the ability to propagate changes across layers.

### Breakpoints and Watchpoints

* **Breakpoints**: Set breakpoints at specific points in the code, across layers.
* **Watchpoints**: Set watchpoints on variables, triggering when their values change.

## Implementation Considerations

### Technology Stack

* **IDE Plugins**: Develop plugins for popular IDEs (e.g., VSCode, IntelliJ) using their respective extension APIs.
* **Backend Services**: Host AI debugging services on scalable cloud infrastructure.
* **Data Storage**: Use a robust data persistence layer to store and manage debugging data and execution traces.

### Performance and Scalability

* **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency for frequent debugging operations.
* **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute requests across multiple instances of the AI debugging services.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle long-running debugging tasks asynchronously, providing progress updates to the IDE.

### Security and Privacy

* **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for accessing debugging features and data.
* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
* **Audit Logging**: Maintain audit logs of debugging interactions and data access for monitoring and compliance.

## Conclusion

The debugging framework for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm aims to provide comprehensive debugging capabilities across the multi-layered ANRF, leveraging AI to assist developers in understanding and resolving issues. By integrating these features into IDEs, we can create a powerful debugging environment that enhances developer productivity and ensures the correctness of AI-generated and AI-modified code.
