# Version Control Design for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview

This document outlines the design for a version control system to support the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF). The goal is to handle the multi-layered ANRF files, tracking meaningful semantic changes rather than textual differences, and integrating with existing version control systems (e.g., Git).

## Key Features

1. **Semantic Diffing and Merging**: Track and merge changes based on semantic meaning rather than text.
2. **Multi-Layer Versioning**: Handle versioning across IML, SML, and EL layers.
3. **Integration with Existing VCS**: Integrate with existing version control systems (e.g., Git) to leverage familiar workflows.
4. **Visualization of Changes**: Provide visual representations of changes across layers.
5. **Conflict Resolution**: Assist in resolving conflicts with semantic awareness.

## Semantic Diffing and Merging

### Semantic Diffing

* **Entity-Level Diffing**: Compare changes at the level of semantic entities (e.g., functions, classes) rather than lines of code.
* **Relationship-Level Diffing**: Compare changes in relationships between entities (e.g., function calls, data dependencies).
* **Intent-Level Diffing**: Compare changes in high-level intents and design rationale.

### Semantic Merging

* **Entity-Level Merging**: Merge changes at the level of semantic entities, preserving their integrity.
* **Relationship-Level Merging**: Merge changes in relationships, ensuring consistency.
* **Intent-Level Merging**: Merge changes in high-level intents, maintaining alignment with design rationale.

## Multi-Layer Versioning

### Layer-Specific Versioning

1. **IML Versioning**: Track changes in high-level intents and design rationale.
    * Features: Version history of intents, diffing and merging of intent statements.
2. **SML Versioning**: Track changes in semantic relationships and transformations.
    * Features: Version history of semantic entities, diffing and merging of relationships and contracts.
3. **EL Versioning**: Track changes in execution-level code.
    * Features: Version history of execution code, diffing and merging of code fragments.

### Cross-Layer Versioning

* **Cross-Layer Change Tracking**: Track changes that span multiple layers, showing how changes in one layer affect others.
* **Cross-Layer Diffing and Merging**: Diff and merge changes across layers, ensuring semantic consistency.

## Integration with Existing VCS

### Git Integration

* **Git Hooks**: Use Git hooks to trigger semantic diffing and merging operations.
* **Custom Commands**: Provide custom Git commands for semantic operations (e.g., `git semantic-diff`, `git semantic-merge`).
* **Metadata Storage**: Store ANRF metadata in Git repositories, alongside traditional code files.

### Workflow Integration

* **Branching and Merging**: Support traditional Git workflows (branching, merging) with semantic awareness.
* **Commit Messages**: Automatically generate commit messages based on semantic changes.
* **Pull Requests**: Integrate with pull request workflows, providing semantic diff views and conflict resolution tools.

## Visualization of Changes

### Change Visualization

* **Entity-Level Changes**: Visual representations of changes to semantic entities, showing additions, deletions, and modifications.
* **Relationship-Level Changes**: Visual representations of changes to relationships, showing how dependencies and interactions evolve.
* **Intent-Level Changes**: Visual representations of changes to high-level intents, showing how design rationale evolves.

### Change Impact Analysis

* **Impact Analysis**: Analyze the impact of changes across layers, showing how modifications in one layer affect others.
* **Dependency Graphs**: Visual representations of dependencies, highlighting affected entities and relationships.

## Conflict Resolution

### Semantic Conflict Detection

* **Entity-Level Conflicts**: Detect conflicts at the level of semantic entities, highlighting conflicting changes.
* **Relationship-Level Conflicts**: Detect conflicts in relationships, highlighting inconsistencies.
* **Intent-Level Conflicts**: Detect conflicts in high-level intents, highlighting misalignments.

### Conflict Resolution Tools

* **Interactive Conflict Resolution**: Provide interactive tools for resolving conflicts, allowing developers to choose between conflicting changes or merge them.
* **AI-Assisted Resolution**: Use AI to suggest resolutions for conflicts, based on semantic understanding and historical data.

## Implementation Considerations

### Technology Stack

* **Version Control System**: Build on top of existing VCS (e.g., Git) to leverage familiar workflows and infrastructure.
* **Backend Services**: Host semantic diffing and merging services on scalable cloud infrastructure.
* **Data Storage**: Use a robust data persistence layer to store and manage ANRF metadata and version history.

### Performance and Scalability

* **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms to reduce latency for frequent version control operations.
* **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute requests across multiple instances of the version control services.
* **Asynchronous Processing**: Handle long-running version control tasks asynchronously, providing progress updates to the user.

### Security and Privacy

* **Access Control**: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage permissions for accessing version control features and data.
* **Data Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access.
* **Audit Logging**: Maintain audit logs of version control interactions and data access for monitoring and compliance.

## Conclusion

The version control system for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm aims to provide comprehensive versioning capabilities for the multi-layered ANRF, leveraging semantic diffing and merging to track meaningful changes. By integrating with existing VCS and providing visualization and conflict resolution tools, we can create a powerful version control environment that enhances developer productivity and ensures the integrity of AI-generated and AI-modified code.
