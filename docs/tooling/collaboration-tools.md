# Collaboration Tools for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview
This document outlines the integration of AI components into the collaboration tools for the ANRF ecosystem. It focuses on how tools will interact with AI-generated confidence scores, AI Checker results, AI Verification Assistance, and the MLOps processes. The goal is to provide a seamless and intuitive experience for developers while leveraging the advanced capabilities of the AI models.

## Core Functionality

### 1. Confidence Score Integration
- **Primary Capabilities and Features**:
  - Display probabilistic confidence scores (prediction sets/intervals) generated by AI models using Conformal Prediction.
  - Provide visual indicators of confidence levels (e.g., color-coded bars, confidence intervals).
  - Allow developers to drill down into the details of the confidence scores (e.g., view prediction sets, intervals, and underlying data).
- **User Interaction Model**:
  - IDE integration with inline confidence indicators next to generated code or ANRF elements.
  - CI/CD pipeline integration with confidence score summaries in build reports.
- **Data Processing Approach**:
  - Retrieve confidence scores from AI Generation Services via API.
  - Process and display scores in a user-friendly format.
- **Key Algorithms and Methods**:
  - Conformal Prediction for generating confidence scores.
  - Visualization techniques for displaying probabilistic data.

### 2. AI Checker Integration
- **Primary Capabilities and Features**:
  - Trigger specific AI checks on demand (e.g., Structural Consistency, Type Checking, Anti-Pattern Detection).
  - Display results (Pass/Fail/Warning) with evidence and location of issues.
  - Provide actionable suggestions for resolving detected issues.
- **User Interaction Model**:
  - IDE integration with on-demand AI check triggers (e.g., context menu options, keyboard shortcuts).
  - CI/CD pipeline integration with automated AI checks during builds.
- **Data Processing Approach**:
  - Send requests to AI Checker Services via API.
  - Process and display results in a user-friendly format.
- **Key Algorithms and Methods**:
  - AI models for various checks (GNNs, pattern matchers, anomaly detectors).
  - Visualization techniques for displaying check results and evidence.

### 3. AI Assistance Integration
- **Primary Capabilities and Features**:
  - Invoke AI Verification Assistance services (e.g., inconsistency detection, mapping suggestion, prioritization).
  - Display suggestions and recommendations to developers.
  - Allow developers to accept, reject, or modify AI suggestions.
- **User Interaction Model**:
  - IDE integration with AI assistance triggers (e.g., context menu options, keyboard shortcuts).
  - Visualization of AI suggestions and recommendations within the IDE.
- **Data Processing Approach**:
  - Send requests to AI Assistance Services via API.
  - Process and display suggestions in a user-friendly format.
- **Key Algorithms and Methods**:
  - Embedding-based similarity search, sequence-to-sequence models, supervised prioritization models.
  - Visualization techniques for displaying AI suggestions and recommendations.

### 4. MLOps Visibility
- **Primary Capabilities and Features**:
  - Provide visibility into the underlying MLOps processes (e.g., model versions, training status).
  - Display relevant MLOps information to advanced users or for debugging purposes.
- **User Interaction Model**:
  - IDE integration with MLOps dashboards or panels.
  - CI/CD pipeline integration with MLOps status summaries in build reports.
- **Data Processing Approach**:
  - Retrieve MLOps information from the model registry and monitoring systems.
  - Process and display information in a user-friendly format.
- **Key Algorithms and Methods**:
  - MLOps monitoring and reporting tools (e.g., MLflow, SageMaker, Vertex AI).

### 5. Feedback Loop
- **Primary Capabilities and Features**:
  - Allow developers to provide feedback on AI suggestions and verification results.
  - Route feedback to the MLOps pipeline for model improvement.
- **User Interaction Model**:
  - IDE integration with feedback submission options (e.g., context menu options, feedback forms).
  - CI/CD pipeline integration with feedback collection mechanisms.
- **Data Processing Approach**:
  - Collect and route feedback to the MLOps pipeline.
  - Process feedback for model retraining and improvement.
- **Key Algorithms and Methods**:
  - Feedback collection and processing techniques.
  - Integration with MLOps retraining pipelines.
