# Tool Development Plan for Phase 1 (Internal Dogfooding)

This document outlines the detailed plan for developing the tools required for Phase 1 of the AI-Native Programming Paradigm, focusing on the IDE plugin, ANRF parsing and manipulation libraries, visualization components, and integration with AI services.

## Overview

The tool development plan for Phase 1 aims to provide developers with the necessary tools to interact with the AI-Native Programming Paradigm effectively. This includes an IDE plugin for code generation, modification, review, and debugging, as well as libraries for parsing and manipulating the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF).

- **User Interaction Model**: Real-time generation, interactive viewing, continuous verification
- **Data Processing Approach**: AI model integration, confidence scoring, verification feedback
- **Key Algorithms and Methods**: Model inference, confidence calculation, verification checks

#### Integration Points
- **Generation Service**: Converts intent descriptions into ANRF instances
- **Viewing Service**: Provides human-readable views of ANRF instances
- **Verification Service**: Validates ANRF instances against constraints and correctness criteria

### 5. Implementation of UX Specifications

#### Design Overview
- **Primary Capabilities**: Implementing the interaction model, visualization framework, and workflow design
- **User Interaction Model**: Layer-based navigation, progressive disclosure, real-time feedback
