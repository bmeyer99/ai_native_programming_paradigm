# Testing Approach for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-04-11)

This document defines the testing approach for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm, with a focus on the secure-by-default implementation. It specifies strategies for verifying code correctness, security properties, and performance.

## 1. Overview

The testing approach provides a comprehensive strategy for verifying the correctness, security, and performance of AI-native code. With the secure-by-default approach, security verification is now a core component of the testing framework, ensuring that all code meets security requirements by default.

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Multi-Layer Testing**: Testing must cover all representation layers
- **Security-First Verification**: Security properties must be verified by default
- **Automated Verification**: Testing should be automated where possible
