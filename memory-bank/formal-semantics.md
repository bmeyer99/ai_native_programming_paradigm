# Formal Semantics for AI-Native Representation Format

## Overview

This document defines the formal semantics of the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF), providing a precise mathematical specification of the meaning and behavior of representation elements. These formal semantics serve as the foundation for verification, optimization, and translation, ensuring that transformations preserve the intended meaning of the code.

## Semantic Domains

The formal semantics are defined over several semantic domains:

### Value Domain (V)

The domain of values that can be computed and manipulated:

- **Basic Values**: Integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, strings, etc.
- **Compound Values**: Arrays, records, objects, etc.
- **Function Values**: First-class functions and closures
- **Reference Values**: Memory references and pointers
- **Special Values**: Undefined, null, error, etc.

Formally:
```
V = B ∪ C ∪ F ∪ R ∪ S
```

Where:
- `B`: Basic values
- `C`: Compound values
- `F`: Function values
- `R`: Reference values
- `S`: Special values

### State Domain (Σ)

The domain of program states:

- **Memory State**: The state of memory
- **Environment**: Mapping from variables to values
- **Control State**: The current control point
- **Effect State**: The state of computational effects

Formally:
```
Σ = M × E × C × F
```

Where:
- `M`: Memory states
- `E`: Environments
- `C`: Control states
- `F`: Effect states

### Behavior Domain (B)

The domain of observable behaviors:

- **Value Behaviors**: Computed values
- **Effect Behaviors**: Observable effects
- **Termination Behaviors**: Normal termination, errors, non-termination
- **Interaction Behaviors**: Interactions with the external environment

Formally:
```
B = V × E × T × I
```

Where:
- `V`: Value behaviors
- `E`: Effect behaviors
- `T`: Termination behaviors
- `I`: Interaction behaviors

## Semantic Functions

The semantics are defined by several semantic functions:

### Execution Layer Semantics (E⟦⟧)

The semantics of the Execution Layer:

```
E⟦p⟧: EL → (Σ → B)
```

This function maps an Execution Layer program `p` to a function from initial states to behaviors.

### Semantic Mapping Layer Semantics (S⟦⟧)

The semantics of the Semantic Mapping Layer:

```
S⟦p⟧: SML → (Σ → P(B))
```

This function maps a Semantic Mapping Layer program `p` to a function from initial states to sets of behaviors (to account for underspecification).

### Intent Metadata Layer Semantics (I⟦⟧)

The semantics of the Intent Metadata Layer:

```
I⟦p⟧: IML → (Σ → P(B))
```

This function maps an Intent Metadata Layer program `p` to a function from initial states to sets of behaviors (to account for intent-level abstraction).

### Cross-Layer Semantics (C⟦⟧)

The semantics of the complete ANRF representation:

```
C⟦p⟧: ANRF → (Σ → B)
```

This function maps a complete ANRF program `p` to a function from initial states to behaviors, integrating the semantics of all layers.

## Operational Semantics

The operational semantics define how ANRF programs execute step by step.

### Small-Step Semantics

The small-step semantics define individual execution steps:

```
⟨p, σ⟩ → ⟨p', σ'⟩
```

This relation states that program `p` in state `σ` steps to program `p'` in state `σ'`.

### Big-Step Semantics

The big-step semantics define complete executions:

```
⟨p, σ⟩ ⇓ ⟨v, σ'⟩
```

This relation states that program `p` in state `σ` evaluates to value `v` in state `σ'`.

## Denotational Semantics

The denotational semantics define the meaning of ANRF programs in terms of mathematical functions.

### Expression Semantics

For expressions in the Execution Layer:

```
E⟦e⟧ρ = λσ. (v, σ')
```

Where:
- `e`: An expression
- `ρ`: An environment
- `σ`: An initial state
- `v`: The resulting value
- `σ'`: The resulting state

### Statement Semantics

For statements in the Execution Layer:

```
S⟦s⟧ρ = λσ. σ'
```

Where:
- `s`: A statement
- `ρ`: An environment
- `σ`: An initial state
- `σ'`: The resulting state

### Program Semantics

For complete programs:

```
P⟦p⟧ = λσ. (v, σ')
```

Where:
- `p`: A program
- `σ`: An initial state
- `v`: The resulting value
- `σ'`: The resulting state

## Axiomatic Semantics

The axiomatic semantics define the meaning of ANRF programs in terms of logical assertions.

### Hoare Triples

```
{P} p {Q}
```

This states that if precondition `P` holds before executing program `p`, then postcondition `Q` will hold after execution.

### Verification Conditions

For each construct in ANRF, verification conditions define what must be proven to establish correctness:

```
VC(p, P, Q) = ...
```

Where:
- `p`: A program
- `P`: A precondition
- `Q`: A postcondition
- `VC(p, P, Q)`: The verification condition

## Type Semantics

The type semantics define the meaning of types in ANRF.

### Type Interpretation

```
⟦T⟧ = {v ∈ V | v has type T}
```

This defines the set of values that have type `T`.

### Typing Judgments

```
Γ ⊢ e : T
```

This states that expression `e` has type `T` in typing context `Γ`.

### Type Safety

Type safety is defined by two properties:

1. **Progress**: Well-typed programs don't get stuck
2. **Preservation**: Types are preserved by execution steps

Formally:
```
If ∅ ⊢ p : T and ⟨p, σ⟩ →* ⟨p', σ'⟩, then either:
1. p' is a value, or
2. ∃p'', σ'' such that ⟨p', σ'⟩ → ⟨p'', σ''⟩
```

```
If ∅ ⊢ p : T and ⟨p, σ⟩ → ⟨p', σ'⟩, then ∅ ⊢ p' : T
```

## Semantic Equivalence

Semantic equivalence defines when two ANRF programs have the same meaning.

### Observational Equivalence

```
p1 ≈ p2 iff ∀σ. C⟦p1⟧(σ) = C⟦p2⟧(σ)
```

This states that programs `p1` and `p2` are equivalent if they produce the same behaviors for all initial states.

### Contextual Equivalence

```
p1 ≈ctx p2 iff ∀C. C[p1] ≈ C[p2]
```

This states that programs `p1` and `p2` are equivalent if they produce the same behaviors in all program contexts `C`.

### Refinement

```
p1 ⊑ p2 iff ∀σ. C⟦p1⟧(σ) ⊆ C⟦p2⟧(σ)
```

This states that program `p1` refines program `p2` if the behaviors of `p1` are a subset of the behaviors of `p2`.

## Semantic Preservation

Semantic preservation defines when transformations maintain the meaning of ANRF programs.

### Transformation Correctness

For a transformation `T: ANRF → ANRF`:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF. p ≈ T(p)
```

This states that transformation `T` preserves the meaning of all programs.

### Optimization Correctness

For an optimization `O: ANRF → ANRF`:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF. p ≈ O(p)
```

This states that optimization `O` preserves the meaning of all programs.

### Translation Correctness

For a translation `T: ANRF → H` from ANRF to a human-readable form `H`:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF. p ≈ T^(-1)(T(p))
```

This states that translation `T` preserves the meaning of all programs when round-tripped.

## Formal Rules

The formal semantics include rules for each construct in ANRF.

### Expression Rules

Rules for evaluating expressions:

```
--------------------- (E-Const)
⟨c, σ⟩ → ⟨v, σ⟩

x ∈ dom(σ)

⟨e2, σ'⟩ → ⟨v2, σ''⟩
v = v1 op v2
--------------------- (E-BinOp)
⟨e1 op e2, σ⟩ → ⟨v, σ''⟩
```

### Statement Rules

Rules for executing statements:

```
⟨e, σ⟩ → ⟨v, σ'⟩

--------------------- (S-Seq1)
⟨s1; s2, σ⟩ → ⟨s1'; s2, σ'⟩

--------------------- (S-Seq2)
⟨skip; s2, σ⟩ → ⟨s2, σ⟩

⟨e, σ⟩ → ⟨false, σ'⟩
--------------------- (S-IfFalse)
⟨if e then s1 else s2, σ⟩ → ⟨s2, σ'⟩

⟨e, σ⟩ → ⟨false, σ'⟩
--------------------- (S-WhileFalse)
⟨while e do s, σ⟩ → ⟨skip, σ'⟩

⟨e, σ⟩ → ⟨true, σ'⟩
--------------------- (S-WhileTrue)
⟨while e do s, σ⟩ → ⟨s; while e do s, σ'⟩
```

### Type Rules

Rules for type checking:

```
--------------------- (T-Const)
Γ ⊢ c : typeof(c)

x : T ∈ Γ
--------------------- (T-Var)
Γ ⊢ x : T

Γ ⊢ e1 : T1
Γ ⊢ e2 : T2
T = resultType(op, T1, T2)
--------------------- (T-BinOp)
Γ ⊢ e1 op e2 : T

Γ ⊢ e : bool
Γ ⊢ s1 : unit
Γ ⊢ s2 : unit
--------------------- (T-If)
Γ ⊢ if e then s1 else s2 : unit

Γ ⊢ e : bool
Γ ⊢ s : unit
--------------------- (T-While)
Γ ⊢ while e do s : unit
```

## Semantic Models

The formal semantics are supported by several semantic models:

### Memory Model

The memory model defines how memory is represented and accessed:

- **Allocation**: How memory is allocated
- **Access**: How memory is accessed
- **Deallocation**: How memory is deallocated
- **Concurrency**: How concurrent access is handled

### Concurrency Model

The concurrency model defines how concurrent execution is represented:

- **Threads**: How threads are represented
- **Synchronization**: How threads are synchronized
- **Communication**: How threads communicate
- **Scheduling**: How threads are scheduled

## Verification Techniques

The formal semantics enable several verification techniques:

### Type Checking

Verifying type correctness:

```
typeCheck(p) = true iff ∅ ⊢ p : T for some T
```

### Model Checking

Verifying temporal properties:

```
modelCheck(p, φ) = true iff p ⊨ φ
```

Where `φ` is a temporal logic formula.

### Theorem Proving

Verifying logical properties:

```
prove(p, P, Q) = true iff {P} p {Q} is valid
```

### Abstract Interpretation

Approximating program behaviors:

```
abstractInterpret(p) = α(C⟦p⟧)
```

Where `α` is an abstraction function.

## Semantic Composition

The formal semantics define how ANRF components compose:

### Sequential Composition

```
C⟦p1; p2⟧(σ) = C⟦p2⟧(C⟦p1⟧(σ))
```

### Parallel Composition

```
C⟦p1 || p2⟧(σ) = C⟦p1⟧(σ) || C⟦p2⟧(σ)
```

### Hierarchical Composition

```
C⟦p1 ∘ p2⟧(σ) = C⟦p1⟧(C⟦p2⟧(σ))
```

## Semantic Extensions

The formal semantics can be extended in several ways:

### Domain-Specific Semantics

Semantics for domain-specific constructs:

```
D⟦p⟧: DSL → (Σ → B)
```

### Probabilistic Semantics

Semantics for probabilistic computations:

```
P⟦p⟧: ANRF → (Σ → Dist(B))
```

Where `Dist(B)` is a probability distribution over behaviors.

### Quantum Semantics

Semantics for quantum computations:

```
Q⟦p⟧: ANRF → (Σ → QState)
```

Where `QState` is a quantum state.

## Formal Properties

The formal semantics guarantee several important properties:

### Determinism

For deterministic programs:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF_det, σ ∈ Σ. |C⟦p⟧(σ)| = 1
```

### Termination

For terminating programs:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF_term, σ ∈ Σ. C⟦p⟧(σ) ≠ ⊥
```

### Safety

For safe programs:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF_safe, σ ∈ Σ. error ∉ C⟦p⟧(σ)
```

### Liveness

For live programs:

```
∀p ∈ ANRF_live, σ ∈ Σ, φ ∈ Φ. p, σ ⊨ ◇φ
```

Where `◇φ` means "eventually φ".

## Semantic Integration

The formal semantics define how ANRF integrates with other systems:

### Foreign Function Interface

```
FFI⟦p⟧: ANRF × Foreign → (Σ → B)
```

### System Integration

```
SYS⟦p⟧: ANRF × System → (Σ → B)
```

### Language Interoperability

```
INTER⟦p⟧: ANRF × Lang → (Σ → B)
```
