# Developer Workflow Design for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview

This document outlines the workflow architecture for developers working with the AI-Native Programming Paradigm. The goal is to create efficient, intuitive workflows that leverage AI capabilities while maintaining developer control and understanding across all layers of ANRF.

## Core Workflow Principles

1. **Intent-Driven Development**: Start with clear intent specification and refinement.
2. **Progressive Refinement**: Move smoothly from high-level concepts to detailed implementation.
3. **AI Collaboration**: Seamless integration of AI assistance throughout the workflow.
4. **Continuous Feedback**: Immediate feedback and verification at all stages.
5. **Developer Control**: Clear mechanisms for oversight and intervention.
