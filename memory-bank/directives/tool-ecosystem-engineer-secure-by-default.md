# Directive to Tool Ecosystem Engineer: Verification Tools for Secure-by-Default

## Context

The Security Specialist has proposed a fundamental shift in our approach to memory safety and sandboxing, moving from an opt-in model to a secure-by-default approach. This has been approved as a core architectural decision, and the Systems Architect is currently updating the execution model to enforce this approach.

Your Tool Development Plan (completed on 2025-04-07) needs to be updated to ensure that verification tools treat the absence of safety/sandboxing as an error and that CI/CD pipelines enforce security requirements. Currently, the tools may not specifically verify security properties or may treat them as optional.

## Task

Update the Tool Development Plan to support secure-by-default verification and enforcement. Specifically:

1. Enhance ANRF parsing and manipulation libraries to validate security metadata
2. Update verification tools to treat absence of safety/sandboxing as an error
3. Implement CI/CD pipeline enforcement of security requirements
4. Design diff visualization to highlight security changes
5. Enhance debugging tools to respect sandboxing boundaries
6. Update testing and validation methodology to include security verification

## Considerations

- **Validation Rules**: Define clear validation rules that treat absence of security metadata as an error
- **CI/CD Integration**: Design how security requirements will be enforced in CI/CD pipelines
- **Override Approval**: Implement review processes for security override approvals
- **Diff Visualization**: Design how security changes will be highlighted in diffs
- **Debugging Experience**: Ensure debugging tools respect sandboxing boundaries while remaining effective
- **Testing Methodology**: Update testing approach to include security verification
- **Performance Impact**: Consider how security verification might affect tool performance

## Expected Outcome

- Updated Tool Development Plan with secure-by-default as a core requirement
- Enhanced ANRF parsing and manipulation libraries with security validation
- Updated verification tools that treat absence of safety as an error
- CI/CD pipeline design with security enforcement
- Diff visualization design highlighting security changes
- Enhanced debugging tools respecting sandboxing boundaries
- Updated testing and validation methodology including security verification

## Handoff Guidance

Upon completion, provide the following handoffs:

1. **To Developer Experience Designer**: Tool capabilities for security visualization in IDE plugins
2. **To AI Integration Specialist**: Verification tool interfaces for AI model integration
3. **To Language Designer**: Feedback on metadata schema for security verification
4. **To Systems Architect**: Tool requirements for runtime security enforcement
5. **To Implementation Strategist**: CI/CD pipeline design for security enforcement
6. **To Paradigm Orchestrator**: Comprehensive tool update report

## Timeline

Please coordinate with the Systems Architect who is currently updating the execution model and the Language Designer who is updating the ANRF specification. Your updates should be completed within two weeks to align with the overall secure-by-default implementation timeline.
