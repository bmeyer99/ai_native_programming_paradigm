# Directive to Developer Experience Designer: Security Visualization and Override UI

## Context

The Security Specialist has proposed a fundamental shift in our approach to memory safety and sandboxing, moving from an opt-in model to a secure-by-default approach. This has been approved as a core architectural decision, and the Systems Architect is currently updating the execution model to enforce this approach.

Your UX Implementation Specifications (completed on 2025-04-07) need to be updated to ensure that security status is clearly indicated in the UI and that overriding security defaults requires explicit, informed action from developers. Currently, the UI design doesn't specifically address security visualization or override workflows.

## Task

Update the UX Implementation Specifications to support secure-by-default visualization and override workflows. Specifically:

1. Design clear visual indicators for security status across all three layers (Intent, Semantic, Execution)
2. Create explicit override interfaces that require justification and confirmation
3. Design security impact visualization for code modifications
4. Update error handling and feedback mechanisms for security violations
5. Enhance debugging interfaces to highlight security-related issues
6. Ensure progressive disclosure strategy includes security information at appropriate levels

## Considerations

- **Visual Language**: Develop a consistent visual language for security status (safe, override, unknown)
- **Override Workflow**: Design a workflow that requires explicit action and justification for security overrides
- **Impact Visualization**: Show how code modifications affect security properties
- **Error Handling**: Design clear error messages and recovery paths for security violations
- **Debugging Experience**: Ensure security context is preserved and visible during debugging
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Balance security information visibility with cognitive load
- **User Research**: Consider how to validate these designs with developers to ensure usability

## Expected Outcome

- Updated UX Implementation Specifications with secure-by-default as a core requirement
- Visual design for security status indicators across all three layers
- Workflow design for security override processes
- Mockups showing security impact visualization
- Enhanced error handling and feedback mechanisms for security violations
- Updated debugging interfaces highlighting security-related issues
- Revised progressive disclosure strategy including security information

## Handoff Guidance

Upon completion, provide the following handoffs:

1. **To Tool Ecosystem Engineer**: UI specifications for implementing security visualization in IDE plugins
2. **To AI Integration Specialist**: Requirements for security explanation generation
3. **To Language Designer**: Feedback on metadata schema for security visualization
4. **To Systems Architect**: UI requirements for runtime security enforcement feedback
5. **To Paradigm Orchestrator**: Comprehensive UX update report

## Timeline

Please coordinate with the Systems Architect who is currently updating the execution model and the Language Designer who is updating the ANRF specification. Your updates should be completed within two weeks to align with the overall secure-by-default implementation timeline.
