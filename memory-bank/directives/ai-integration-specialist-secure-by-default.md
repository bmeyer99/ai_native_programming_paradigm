# Directive to AI Integration Specialist: Secure-by-Default Code Generation

## Context

The Security Specialist has proposed a fundamental shift in our approach to memory safety and sandboxing, moving from an opt-in model to a secure-by-default approach. This has been approved as a core architectural decision, and the Systems Architect is currently updating the execution model to enforce this approach.

Your AI Model Development and Training Plan (completed on 2025-04-07) needs to be updated to ensure that all AI models generate memory-safe, sandboxed code by default. Currently, the models may generate code with varying levels of security based on the training data and prompts.

## Task

Update the AI model development and training approach to ensure secure-by-default code generation. Specifically:

1. Revise training data preparation to emphasize memory-safe, sandboxed code patterns
2. Update model fine-tuning strategies to reinforce secure-by-default behavior
3. Implement detection mechanisms for identifying when code generation requests are attempting to override security defaults
4. Design confidence scoring that accounts for security properties
5. Ensure explanations include security rationale for generated code
6. Update transformation processes to preserve security properties during optimization

## Considerations

- **Training Data**: Consider how to augment existing training data with secure code examples
- **Model Behavior**: Define how models should handle requests that might lead to unsafe code
- **Override Detection**: Design mechanisms to identify when a request is attempting to override security defaults
- **Explanation Generation**: Ensure explanations include security properties and rationale
- **Performance Impact**: Consider how security requirements might affect model performance and response time
- **Verification Integration**: Design how AI models will interact with verification tools to validate security properties

## Expected Outcome

- Updated AI Model Development and Training Plan with secure-by-default as a core requirement
- Revised training data preparation approach emphasizing secure code patterns
- Enhanced fine-tuning strategies that reinforce secure-by-default behavior
- Mechanisms for handling override requests with appropriate documentation
- Updated confidence scoring that accounts for security properties
- Integration plan with verification tools for validating security properties

## Handoff Guidance

Upon completion, provide the following handoffs:

1. **To Language Designer**: Feedback on ANRF metadata schema for representing security properties
2. **To Tool Ecosystem Engineer**: Requirements for AI-verification tool integration
3. **To Developer Experience Designer**: Explanation generation approach for security properties
4. **To Systems Architect**: AI model behavior specifications for runtime security enforcement
5. **To Paradigm Orchestrator**: Comprehensive AI update report

## Timeline

Please coordinate with the Systems Architect who is currently updating the execution model and the Language Designer who is updating the ANRF specification. Your updates should be completed within two weeks to align with the overall secure-by-default implementation timeline.
