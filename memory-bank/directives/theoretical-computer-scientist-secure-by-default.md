# Directive to Theoretical Computer Scientist: Formal Validation of Secure-by-Default Properties

## Context

The Security Specialist has proposed a fundamental shift in our approach to memory safety and sandboxing, moving from an opt-in model to a secure-by-default approach. This has been approved as a core architectural decision, and the Systems Architect is currently updating the execution model to enforce this approach.

Your formal mathematical framework (completed on 2025-04-06) needs to be extended to validate the security properties of the secure-by-default approach. We need formal guarantees about the security properties and their preservation during transformations.

## Task

Extend the formal mathematical framework to validate the secure-by-default approach. Specifically:

1. Define formal security properties for memory safety and sandboxing
2. Extend semantic functions to include security properties
3. Formulate axioms for security preservation during transformations
4. Develop formal verification approaches for security properties
5. Analyze the theoretical implications of security overrides
6. Provide formal guarantees about the security properties

## Considerations

- **Formal Properties**: Define what it means formally for code to be memory-safe and properly sandboxed
- **Semantic Preservation**: Extend semantic preservation to include security properties
- **Transformation Correctness**: Ensure transformations preserve security properties
- **Override Semantics**: Formalize the semantics of security overrides
- **Verification Approaches**: Develop formal verification approaches for security properties
- **Theoretical Limitations**: Identify any theoretical limitations or tradeoffs

## Expected Outcome

- Extended formal mathematical framework including security properties
- Formal definitions of memory safety and sandboxing in the context of ANRF
- Axioms for security preservation during transformations
- Formal verification approaches for security properties
- Analysis of security override semantics
- Formal guarantees about the security properties of the paradigm

## Handoff Guidance

Upon completion, provide the following handoffs:

1. **To Systems Architect**: Formal validation of execution model security properties
2. **To Language Designer**: Formal requirements for ANRF security metadata
3. **To AI Integration Specialist**: Formal verification approaches for AI-generated code
4. **To Tool Ecosystem Engineer**: Formal specifications for verification tools
5. **To Paradigm Orchestrator**: Comprehensive theoretical analysis report

## Timeline

Please coordinate with the Systems Architect who is currently updating the execution model and other specialists working on secure-by-default implementation. Your updates should be completed within two weeks to align with the overall secure-by-default implementation timeline.
