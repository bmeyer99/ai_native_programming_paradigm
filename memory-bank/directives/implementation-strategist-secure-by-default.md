# Directive to Implementation Strategist: Migration Strategy for Secure-by-Default

## Context

The Security Specialist has proposed a fundamental shift in our approach to memory safety and sandboxing, moving from an opt-in model to a secure-by-default approach. This has been approved as a core architectural decision, and the Systems Architect is currently updating the execution model to enforce this approach.

Your Core Team Selection and Onboarding Plan (completed on 2025-04-07) needs to be updated to include migration guidance for existing code and integrations, as well as adoption strategies for the secure-by-default approach. This is a significant change that will affect how developers interact with the paradigm and how existing code is handled.

## Task

Develop a comprehensive migration and adoption strategy for the secure-by-default approach. Specifically:

1. Create migration guidance for existing code and integrations
2. Design a grace period strategy with warnings before strict enforcement
3. Develop tooling requirements to assist developers in identifying and fixing unsafe code
4. Update training program to emphasize secure-by-default principles
5. Enhance onboarding process to include security awareness
6. Design adoption metrics to track secure-by-default compliance
7. Update feedback collection approach to capture security-related feedback

## Considerations

- **Migration Path**: Define clear steps for migrating existing code to comply with secure-by-default requirements
- **Grace Period**: Design a phased approach with warnings before strict enforcement
- **Tooling Support**: Identify tooling needs to assist developers in the transition
- **Training Impact**: Update training materials to emphasize secure-by-default principles
- **Adoption Metrics**: Define how to measure successful adoption of secure-by-default
- **Feedback Collection**: Enhance feedback mechanisms to capture security-related insights
- **Team Impact**: Consider how this change affects team dynamics and productivity

## Expected Outcome

- Comprehensive migration strategy for existing code and integrations
- Phased adoption plan with clear timelines and milestones
- Tooling requirements specification for migration assistance
- Updated training program emphasizing secure-by-default principles
- Enhanced onboarding process with security awareness components
- Adoption metrics for tracking secure-by-default compliance
- Updated feedback collection approach for security-related insights

## Handoff Guidance

Upon completion, provide the following handoffs:

1. **To Systems Architect**: Migration strategy technical requirements
2. **To Tool Ecosystem Engineer**: Tooling requirements for migration assistance
3. **To Developer Experience Designer**: Training and onboarding updates for security awareness
4. **To AI Integration Specialist**: Feedback on AI model behavior during migration
5. **To Paradigm Orchestrator**: Comprehensive implementation strategy report

## Timeline

Please coordinate with the Systems Architect who is currently updating the execution model and other specialists working on secure-by-default implementation. Your updates should be completed within two weeks to align with the overall secure-by-default implementation timeline.
