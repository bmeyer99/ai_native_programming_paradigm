# Directive to Systems Architect: Secure-by-Default Implementation

## Context

The Security Specialist has proposed a fundamental shift in our approach to memory safety and sandboxing, moving from an opt-in model to a secure-by-default approach where all code generated and executed in the AI-Native Programming Paradigm is memory-safe and sandboxed by default, with opt-out possible only via explicit override.

This aligns with our verification-centric architecture principle and strengthens our security posture considerably. The execution model you recently drafted (April 11, 2025) includes sandboxing components but doesn't establish them as mandatory defaults.

Your recent completion of the execution model documentation provides an excellent foundation for implementing this secure-by-default approach. The timing is opportune as we can integrate these security enhancements before Phase 1 implementation begins.

## Task

Update the execution model and related architectural components to enforce secure-by-default behavior. Specifically:

1. Revise the execution model to make sandboxing and memory safety the default state for all execution modes (Interpretation, JIT, AOT)
2. Design explicit override mechanisms that require justification and are auditable
3. Identify all system components that need updates to enforce this approach
4. Provide guidance to other specialists on architectural changes needed in their domains

## Considerations

- **Performance Impact**: Consider the performance implications of enforcing memory safety and sandboxing by default. Design optimizations that mitigate overhead without compromising security.
- **Override Granularity**: Determine the appropriate granularity for override controls (per function, module, project).
- **Audit Requirements**: Design a comprehensive audit trail for security overrides that captures justifications and maintains traceability.
- **Integration Points**: Consider how this change affects all integration points documented in the integration-map.md file.
- **Verification Strategy**: Define how verification services will treat the absence of safety/sandboxing as an error.
- **Migration Path**: Consider how existing code will be handled during migration to secure-by-default.

## Expected Outcome

- Updated execution model documentation with secure-by-default as the foundational principle
- Comprehensive architectural guidance for implementing secure-by-default across all system components
- Clear specifications for override mechanisms, audit requirements, and security enforcement
- Technical requirements for each specialist domain to implement secure-by-default

## Handoff Guidance

Upon completion, provide the following handoffs:

1. **To Language Designer**: Requirements for updating ANRF metadata schema to encode safety/sandboxing as required fields
2. **To AI Integration Specialist**: Requirements for ensuring AI models generate memory-safe, sandboxed code by default
3. **To Developer Experience Designer**: Requirements for safety status indicators and override UI
4. **To Tool Ecosystem Engineer**: Requirements for verification tools to treat absence of safety as an error
5. **To Implementation Strategist**: Technical implications for migration and adoption
6. **To Paradigm Orchestrator**: Comprehensive secure-by-default implementation plan

## Timeline

Given the importance of this security enhancement and its impact on Phase 1 implementation, please prioritize this task and provide an initial response within one week.
