# Implementation Plan: Confidence Scoring & Verification Assistance

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the implementation strategy for the Confidence Scoring and Verification Assistance features within the AI-Native Programming Paradigm. It builds upon the completed design specifications for AI model architecture (`model-architecture.md`), metadata schema (`metadata-schema.md`), tooling support (`tool-integration.md`), and developer experience (`interaction-model.md`).

The goal is to deliver these critical features incrementally, providing early value while managing complexity and risk.

## 2. Phased Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundational Confidence Scoring (MVP)

*   **Objective:** Provide basic, real-time confidence indicators within the IDE.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Implement core metadata schema (`metadata-schema.md`).
    *   Implement basic AI confidence scoring models (e.g., calibrated softmax probability, simple OOD heuristics) within the AI Integration Service.
    *   Implement the IDE Integration Layer/Gateway (v1).
    *   Implement basic visual indicators (color coding, icons) in the VSCode IDE extension (`tool-integration.md`).
    *   Implement basic hover-over details panel (`interaction-model.md`).
    *   Implement basic configuration for warning thresholds.
*   **Value Proposition:** Early visibility into AI generation confidence, enabling developers to focus review efforts.
*   **Dependencies:** Core ANRF representation, basic AI generation capabilities, Metadata Store API, basic IDE extension framework.

#### Phase 1 Deployment & Adoption Details

*   **Deployment Plan:**
    *   **IDE Integration Layer/Gateway (v1):** Deploy as a containerized service (e.g., Docker) in a cloud environment (e.g., AWS ECS/Kubernetes). Initial deployment focused on internal development/testing environment.
    *   **VSCode Extension:** Distribute initially via a private VSIX file for internal alpha testing. Plan for eventual publication to a private marketplace or the official VSCode Marketplace upon stabilization.
*   **Integration Strategy:**
    *   Integrate with the initial developer workflow where AI generates code (ANRF). The extension will automatically request confidence scores for newly generated/modified ANRF segments.
    *   Ensure the Gateway authenticates securely with backend services (AI Confidence Service, Metadata Store).
    *   Minimize disruption by making indicators non-intrusive and providing clear documentation.
*   **Training & Support:**
    *   **Documentation:** Create a concise guide explaining the meaning of confidence indicators (colors, icons), how to interpret the hover panel, and basic configuration options. Include troubleshooting steps for connection issues.
    *   **Tutorial:** Develop a short video or interactive tutorial demonstrating the feature within VSCode.
    *   **Support Channel:** Establish a dedicated channel (e.g., Slack, Teams) for early adopters to ask questions and report issues.
*   **Feedback Mechanisms:**
    *   **In-Tool Feedback:** Implement a simple feedback command within the VSCode extension (e.g., "Report Issue with Confidence Score") that allows users to submit comments linked to the current context.
    *   **Dedicated Channel:** Encourage feedback submission through the established support channel.
    *   **Surveys:** Conduct short, targeted surveys after the initial alpha period to gather structured feedback on usability, performance, and perceived value.


*   **Decision Gate Criteria (Alpha -> Beta):** Progression to a broader beta phase requires meeting the following criteria based on internal alpha testing results:
    *   **Stability:**
        *   No critical (P0/P1) bugs identified in the VSCode extension or Gateway.
        *   Gateway uptime > 99.5% during the testing period.
        *   WebSocket disconnection rate < 1%.
    *   **Performance:**
        *   Average confidence score display latency < 500ms (P95).
        *   Average hover panel display latency < 100ms (P95).
        *   No significant performance degradation reported by > 10% of alpha testers.
    *   **Usability & Value:**
        *   Average rating for "intuitiveness of visual indicators" >= 3.5/5.
        *   Average rating for "usefulness of hover panel information" >= 3.5/5.
        *   Average rating for "likelihood to use daily" >= 3.0/5.
        *   Qualitative feedback indicates the core value proposition (visibility into confidence) is being met for the majority of testers.
        *   No major usability blockers identified by > 20% of testers.
    *   **Feedback:**
        *   Feedback mechanisms (in-tool command, channel) are functional and used by testers.
        *   A clear plan exists to address the top 3-5 feedback themes identified during the alpha.
### Phase 2: Enhanced Confidence & Basic Assistance

*   **Objective:** Introduce more robust confidence measures and initial verification assistance suggestions.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Implement advanced confidence scoring models (e.g., MC Dropout, Ensembles, basic Conformal Prediction).
    *   Implement basic verification assistance models (e.g., simple property/test generation using LLMs).
    *   Implement the `requestVerificationAssistance` API.
    *   Implement the full Confidence Details Panel in the IDE.
    *   Implement basic Verification Assistance UI for displaying suggestions (`interaction-model.md`).
    *   Implement configuration for suggestion frequency and detail level.
    *   Implement basic feedback mechanisms (üëç/üëé).
    *   Expand IDE support (if required).
*   **Value Proposition:** More reliable confidence scores, initial AI help with verification tasks.
*   **Dependencies:** Phase 1 completion, Verification Service API (basic), LLM fine-tuning infrastructure.

### Phase 3: Advanced Assistance & Workflow Integration

*   **Objective:** Integrate sophisticated verification assistance and embed features deeper into workflows.
*   **Scope:**
    *   Implement advanced verification assistance models (e.g., proof step suggestion, counterexample guidance, abstraction generation).
    *   Implement interactive refinement UI for suggestions.
    *   Implement full configuration interface (including team settings).
    *   Integrate confidence scores/verification status into code review tools, CI/CD pipelines (`ci-cd-pipeline.md`).
    *   Implement advanced feedback mechanisms and learning loops.
    *   Implement tiered execution and performance optimizations for AI models.
    *   Implement full accessibility and internationalization support.
*   **Value Proposition:** Significant developer productivity gains in verification, improved code quality through automated checks and reviews.
