# Training Requirements for ANRF AI Models

## Overview

This document outlines the data requirements, training methodologies, and evaluation frameworks needed to develop the AI models that will operate on the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF). These models are responsible for intent translation, optimization, explanation, and verification assistance within the AI-Native Programming Paradigm.

## Data Requirements

High-quality, large-scale datasets are crucial for training effective AI models for ANRF.

### 1. Core ANRF Dataset

*   **Content**: A large corpus of ANRF instances representing diverse programs across various domains and programming paradigms. Each instance must be complete with all three layers (IML, SML, EL) and validated cross-layer references.
*   **Sources**:
    *   **Semi-automated Conversion**: Tools to convert existing codebases (e.g., from GitHub, Stack Overflow) and associated artifacts (documentation, commit messages, issues) into ANRF format. This requires significant effort in inferring IML and SML information.
    *   **Synthetic Generation**: Generate ANRF instances programmatically based on formal grammars or semantic templates.
    *   **Human Annotation/Curation**: Human developers creating or refining ANRF instances, especially the IML layer.
    *   **Simulation**: Generating ANRF instances through simulated development processes or transformations.
*   **Annotation**: Metadata within ANRF (IML, SML, Provenance) serves as implicit annotation. Additional explicit labels might be needed for specific tasks (e.g., bug locations, optimal transformation sequences).
*   **Challenge**: Bootstrapping this dataset is a major undertaking. Initial focus might be on specific domains or language subsets.

### 2. Intent-to-ANRF Parallel Data

*   **Content**: Pairs of human intent expressions (natural language, examples, sketches) and their corresponding ground-truth ANRF representations.
*   **Sources**:
    *   Human developers specifying intent and implementing the corresponding ANRF (potentially using the paradigm's tools).
    *   Mining requirements documents, specifications, and user stories linked to code implementations (followed by conversion to ANRF).
*   **Use**: Training intent translation models (`Gen(I -> R)`).

### 3. Transformation Data

*   **Content**: Pairs of ANRF instances before and after known-correct transformations (optimizations, refactorings). Includes transformation records from the SML.
*   **Sources**:
    *   Applying traditional, provably correct compiler optimizations to ANRF instances and recording the changes.
    *   Logging transformations performed by human developers or verified AI agents.
    *   Synthetically applying transformation rules.
*   **Use**: Training optimization models (`Opt(R -> R')`), semantic equivalence checkers, and transformation verification models.

### 4. Explanation Data

*   **Content**: ANRF instances paired with high-quality human-written explanations (summaries, rationales, behavioral descriptions) at different abstraction levels.
*   **Sources**:
    *   Human experts writing explanations for ANRF examples.
    *   Mining code comments, documentation, and tutorials associated with code (converted to ANRF).
    *   Leveraging user feedback on AI-generated explanations.
*   **Use**: Training explanation generation models (`View(R -> H)`).

### 5. Verification Data

*   **Content**: ANRF instances labeled with known bugs, violated properties, or associated formal proofs/verification results.
*   **Sources**:
    *   Annotating ANRF instances derived from code with known bugs (e.g., from bug databases).
    *   Applying formal verification tools to ANRF instances and recording results.
    *   Mutation testing: introducing semantic errors into ANRF and labeling them.
*   **Use**: Training AI models for bug finding, property generation, and verification assistance.

## Training Methodologies

### 1. Supervised Learning

*   **Application**: Training models for tasks with clear input-output pairs (e.g., intent-to-ANRF translation, explanation generation from ANRF, bug detection).
*   **Techniques**: Standard supervised training using cross-entropy loss, sequence-to-sequence learning, graph-to-graph translation. Requires labeled datasets (Intent-to-ANRF, Explanation Data, Verification Data).

### 2. Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)

*   **Application**: Pre-training models on the large Core ANRF Dataset without explicit labels to learn general representations of ANRF structure and semantics.
*   **Techniques**:
    *   **Masked Modeling**: Masking parts of the ANRF (nodes/edges in EL/SML, text in IML) and training models to predict them.
    *   **Contrastive Learning**: Training models to distinguish similar vs. dissimilar ANRF fragments or transformation pairs.
    *   **Graph Autoencoders**: Learning compressed representations of ANRF graphs.
*   **Benefit**: Leverages large unlabeled ANRF data; learned representations can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks.

### 3. Reinforcement Learning (RL)

*   **Application**: Training agents for sequential decision-making tasks like code optimization (`Opt(R -> R')`) or guiding formal provers.
*   **Techniques**:
    *   Define state (current ANRF), actions (transformations), reward (optimization improvement, proof progress).
    *   Use algorithms like PPO, DQN.
    *   **RL with Formal Constraints**: Incorporate checks for semantic preservation directly into the learning process or reward function.
    *   **RL from Human Feedback (RLHF)**: Fine-tune agents based on human judgments of optimization quality or explanation usefulness.
*   **Challenge**: Defining appropriate reward functions and ensuring safety/correctness constraints are met.

### 4. Multi-Task Learning (MTL)

*   **Application**: Training single models or shared representations for multiple related tasks (e.g., generation, explanation, verification) simultaneously.
*   **Techniques**: Shared model backbones with task-specific heads, joint loss functions.
*   **Benefit**: Can improve generalization and data efficiency by leveraging shared knowledge across tasks. Requires careful architecture design.

### 5. Curriculum Learning

*   **Application**: Gradually increasing the complexity of training data or tasks.
*   **Techniques**: Start training on simpler ANRF instances (e.g., smaller programs, fewer layers populated) or basic tasks before moving to more complex ones.
*   **Benefit**: Can improve training stability and final model performance.

### 6. Transfer Learning & Fine-Tuning

*   **Application**: Leveraging pre-trained models (e.g., large code models, LLMs) as a starting point.
*   **Techniques**: Fine-tune pre-trained models on ANRF-specific datasets and tasks.
*   **Benefit**: Reduces the amount of ANRF-specific data needed for initial model development.

## Evaluation Frameworks

Rigorous evaluation is needed to assess model performance and ensure trustworthiness.

### 1. Task-Specific Metrics

*   **Intent Translation**: Semantic accuracy (comparing generated ANRF to ground truth), BLEU/ROUGE scores (for NL aspects), structural correctness metrics.
*   **Optimization**: Performance improvement (speed, size) on benchmark suites, semantic equivalence verification success rate.
*   **Explanation**: Human ratings (clarity, correctness, usefulness), automated metrics (e.g., ROUGE against reference explanations), task success rate (e.g., debugging time reduction).
*   **Verification Assistance**: Bug detection rate (precision/recall), proof success rate/time reduction, property relevance scores.

### 2. Semantic Preservation Evaluation

*   **Formal Verification**: Apply formal methods to verify semantic equivalence (≈) or refinement (⊑) for transformations generated or suggested by AI.
*   **Differential Testing**: Compare the outputs of original and AI-modified ANRF on a large test suite.
*   **Invariant Checking**: Define key semantic invariants and automatically check if they hold after AI operations.

### 3. Robustness & Generalization Testing

*   Evaluate models on out-of-distribution ANRF instances (different domains, complexities, programming styles).
*   Test robustness against noisy or ambiguous inputs.
*   Assess performance on diverse benchmark suites.

### 4. Human Evaluation

*   Crucial for tasks involving human interaction (intent translation, explanation).
*   Use user studies, A/B testing, and expert reviews to assess usability, comprehensibility, and trustworthiness.

## Infrastructure Requirements

*   **Data Storage & Management**: Scalable storage for large ANRF datasets. Versioning and provenance tracking for data.
*   **Compute Resources**: Significant GPU resources for training large models (LLMs, GNNs, RL agents).
*   **Training Orchestration**: Frameworks for managing complex training pipelines (SSL pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, RL).
*   **Evaluation Platform**: Infrastructure for running automated evaluations and collecting human feedback.

## Conclusion
