# Concept Evolution

This document tracks how core concepts in the AI-Native Programming Paradigm evolve through specialist collaboration.

## Security Concepts

### Secure-by-Default Memory Safety and Sandboxing

**Initial Concept (2025-04-11)**:
- **Originator**: Security Specialist
- **Core Idea**: Make memory safety, sandboxing, and execution policy enforcement the default for all code in the AI-Native Programming Paradigm
- **Key Principles**:
  - Security should be non-negotiable by default
  - Explicit, auditable override required for opting out
  - All system components must enforce this consistently
  - Documentation must reflect secure-by-default as baseline guarantee

**Evolution Stage 1: Architectural Integration (In Progress)**
- **Owner**: Systems Architect
- **Current Focus**: 
  - Updating execution model to enforce secure-by-default behavior
  - Designing explicit override mechanisms with audit requirements
  - Identifying all system components requiring updates
  - Providing guidance to other specialists on required changes
- **Key Developments**:
  - Execution model recently created (2025-04-11), provides foundation for secure-by-default implementation
  - Sandboxing and isolation mechanisms already included in execution model, but not as mandatory defaults
- **Next Evolution**: Technical specifications for each specialist domain

**Planned Evolution Stages**:
1. **Representation Format Updates** (Language Designer)
   - Update ANRF metadata schema to encode safety/sandboxing as required fields
   - Ensure validation rules enforce safety requirements

2. **AI Generation Alignment** (AI Integration Specialist)
   - Update AI models to generate memory-safe, sandboxed code by default
   - Implement explicit override detection in code generation

3. **Developer Experience Integration** (Developer Experience Designer)
   - Design clear UI indicators for safety status
   - Create explicit opt-out interfaces with justification requirements

4. **Verification Enhancement** (Tool Ecosystem Engineer)
   - Update verification tools to treat absence of safety/sandboxing as an error
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline enforcement

5. **Implementation Strategy** (Implementation Strategist)
   - Develop migration guidance for existing code
   - Create adoption strategy for secure-by-default approach

**Relationship to Core Principles**:
- Strengthens "Verification-Centric Architecture" principle by making security verification non-negotiable
- Enhances "Continuous Verification" by enforcing security at every level
- Maintains "Developer Empowerment" by allowing explicit override when necessary, but with appropriate safeguards
