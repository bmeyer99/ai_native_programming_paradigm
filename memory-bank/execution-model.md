# Execution Model Validation Log

## [2025-04-11] Systems Architect Review

### Issue Identified:
- The file `docs/technical/execution/runtime.md` is empty. This represents a critical gap in the documentation for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm.
- The execution model is essential for ensuring consistency between system architecture, verification, integration, and security.
- Absence of this documentation prevents full validation and may cause inconsistencies or misalignments across the paradigm.

### Required Actions:
- Immediate cross-specialist review and completion of the execution model documentation.
- All related domains (architecture, verification, integration, security, representation, AI integration) must review and validate the new execution model for material changes and cascading impacts.

### Next Steps:
1. Notify Paradigm Orchestrator to coordinate a cross-specialist workflow to draft and validate the execution model.
2. Flag this as a blocking issue for overall documentation consistency and validation.

### Cascade Validation Required:
- Systems Architect
- Language Designer
- AI Integration Specialist
- Developer Experience Designer
- Implementation Strategist
- Theoretical Computer Scientist
- Tool Ecosystem Engineer
