# Execution Model Validation Log

## [2025-04-11] Systems Architect Review

### Issue Identified:
- The file `docs/technical/execution/runtime.md` is empty. This represents a critical gap in the documentation for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm.
- The execution model is essential for ensuring consistency between system architecture, verification, integration, and security.
- Absence of this documentation prevents full validation and may cause inconsistencies or misalignments across the paradigm.

### Required Actions:
- Immediate cross-specialist review and completion of the execution model documentation.
- All related domains (architecture, verification, integration, security, representation, AI integration) must review and validate the new execution model for material changes and cascading impacts.

### Next Steps:
1. Notify Paradigm Orchestrator to coordinate a cross-specialist workflow to draft and validate the execution model.
2. Flag this as a blocking issue for overall documentation consistency and validation.

### Cascade Validation Required:
- Systems Architect
- Language Designer
- AI Integration Specialist
- Developer Experience Designer
- Implementation Strategist
- Theoretical Computer Scientist
- Tool Ecosystem Engineer

## [2025-04-11] Secure-by-Default Implementation

### Update Summary:
- Implementing secure-by-default approach for memory safety and sandboxing across all execution modes
- Transitioning from opt-in security model to mandatory security with explicit opt-out
- Designing comprehensive override mechanisms with justification and audit requirements

### Key Changes:
1. **Default Security State**: All execution modes (Interpretation, JIT, AOT) now enforce memory safety and sandboxing by default
2. **Explicit Override Mechanism**: Created a structured approach for security overrides with justification and audit trail
3. **Verification Integration**: Pre-execution verification now mandatory for security properties
4. **ANRF Requirements**: Updated requirements for ANRF metadata to include mandatory security fields
5. **Performance Optimizations**: Designed tiered security enforcement to minimize performance impact

### Integration Requirements:
- **Language Designer**: ANRF metadata schema must be updated to include mandatory security fields
- **AI Integration Specialist**: AI models must generate memory-safe, sandboxed code by default
- **Developer Experience Designer**: UI must clearly indicate security status and require explicit action for overrides
- **Tool Ecosystem Engineer**: Verification tools must treat absence of safety/sandboxing as an error
- **Implementation Strategist**: Migration guidance needed for existing code
- **Theoretical Computer Scientist**: Formal validation required for security properties

### Next Steps:
1. Complete detailed technical specifications for each specialist domain
2. Coordinate cross-specialist implementation
3. Develop comprehensive testing and validation approach
4. Create migration tools and documentation
