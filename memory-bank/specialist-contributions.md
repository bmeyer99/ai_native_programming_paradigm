# Specialist Contributions

This document logs key insights and contributions from each specialist role in the AI-Native Programming Paradigm development.

## Theoretical Computer Scientist

### Formal Mathematical Framework (2025-04-06)
- Developed a set-theoretic and semantic approach to define key spaces (Intent `I`, Representation `R`, Human View `H`, Machine State `M`, Observable Behavior `Obs`)
- Defined core transformations between spaces (Generation `Gen`, Optimization `Opt`, Viewing `View`)
- Established semantic functions (`Sem_I`, `Sem_R`, `Sem_H`) for each space
- Formulated fundamental correctness axioms (Refinement `r ⊑ i`, Equivalence `Opt(r) ≈ r`, Faithfulness `Sem_H(View(r)) ≈_A Sem_R(r)`)
- Created theoretical foundation for ensuring semantic preservation and correctness
