# Developer Experience Design for AI-Native Tools Integration

## Overview
This document outlines the user experience design for integrating AI components into the development tools for the ANRF ecosystem. The design focuses on creating intuitive, transparent, and efficient interactions between developers and AI-powered development tools.

## 1. Confidence Score Visualization

### Interface Design
- **Inline Confidence Indicators**:
  - Color-coded bars next to code elements (green: high confidence, yellow: medium, red: low)
  - Gradient indicators showing confidence distribution
  - Hover tooltips showing exact confidence percentages and prediction intervals
  - Expandable panels for detailed probability distributions

### Interaction Patterns
- **Primary View**: Minimalist confidence indicators that don't clutter the code view
- **Detailed View**: Expandable panels with:
  - Confidence score breakdown by component
  - Alternative suggestions with their confidence scores
  - Historical confidence trends
  - Contributing factors to the confidence score

### Progressive Disclosure
1. Level 1: Basic color indicator
2. Level 2: Hover tooltip with key metrics
3. Level 3: Expanded panel with full details
4. Level 4: Advanced analytics and historical data

## 2. AI Checker Results Display

### Interface Design
- **Issue Indicators**:
  - Inline problem indicators (similar to traditional linters)
  - Severity-based icons (error, warning, suggestion)
  - Smart grouping of related issues
  - Issue preview in gutter

### Interactive Resolution
- **Quick Actions**:
  - One-click fix suggestions
  - Preview changes before applying
  - Batch fix similar issues
  - Ignore/suppress option with documentation

### Context Presentation
- Issue description
- Affected code context
- Potential impact explanation
- Fix rationale and implications
- Related patterns and best practices

## 3. AI Assistance Integration

### Interface Design
- **Command Palette Integration**:
  - Natural language AI assistance commands
  - Context-aware suggestions
  - Keyboard shortcuts for common operations
  - Recent/frequent operations history

### Suggestion Display
- **Inline Suggestions**:
  - Ghost text for immediate suggestions
  - Multiple alternatives available
  - Explanation of why each suggestion is made
  - Impact preview

### Interactive Refinement
- Accept/reject mechanism with feedback
- Modify suggestions through natural language
- Save preferred patterns for future suggestions
- Context retention across interactions

## 4. MLOps Visibility

### Interface Design
- **Status Panel**:
  - Collapsible MLOps dashboard
  - Key metrics at a glance
  - Status indicators for each AI service
  - Training/update progress indicators

### Information Hierarchy
1. Critical status and alerts
2. Active model versions and confidence
3. Recent training activities
4. Performance metrics and trends
5. Detailed logs and diagnostics

### Customization
- Configurable dashboard layouts
- Metric importance weighting
- Alert thresholds and notifications
- View presets for different roles

## 5. Feedback Collection

### Interface Design
- **Feedback Controls**:
  - Quick reaction buttons (thumbs up/down)
  - Contextual feedback forms
  - Voice memo option for detailed feedback
  - Screenshot/recording attachment support

### Feedback Flow
1. Initial reaction capture
2. Optional detailed feedback
3. Impact category selection
4. Reproduction steps (if issue)
5. Suggested improvement

### Feedback Context
- Automatically captured:
  - Code context
  - AI model version
  - Operation type
  - Environment details
  - Recent interactions
