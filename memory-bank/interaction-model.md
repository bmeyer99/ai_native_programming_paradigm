# Interaction Model for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

This document defines the interaction model for how developers will work with the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF) through AI-mediated interfaces. The model addresses intent specification, explanation/visualization, modification/feedback, and control/oversight mechanisms.

## Core Interaction Principles

1. **Multi-Modal Intent Expression**:
   - Natural language descriptions
   - Code examples and sketches
   - Interactive refinement through dialogue
   - Visual programming and direct manipulation

2. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Layer-appropriate views (EL, SML, IML)
   - Context-sensitive abstraction levels
   - Just-in-time explanation of AI decisions
   - Gradual exposure to advanced capabilities

3. **Bidirectional Control**:
   - Developer-initiated actions
   - AI-initiated suggestions
   - Collaborative decision-making
   - Clear authority boundaries

4. **Continuous Learning**:
   - Feedback collection during interaction
   - Preference adaptation over time
   - Knowledge capture from expert users
   - Team convention learning

## Intent Specification Interface

### Natural Language Input
- Contextual command bar for intent expression
- Auto-completion with semantic suggestions
- Interactive disambiguation through clarifying questions
- Preservation of intent rationale in IML

### Example-Based Input
- Code snippet collection and annotation
- Interactive example refinement
- Pattern extraction and generalization
- Counter-example specification

### Visual Programming
- Direct manipulation of ANRF graph structures
- Semantic component assembly
- Constraint specification through visual rules
- Real-time preview of generated code

### Multi-Modal Integration
- Seamless switching between input modes
- Cross-modal intent verification
- Unified history and undo/redo
- Context preservation across modes

## Explanation & Visualization Framework

### Layered View Navigation
```
┌─────────────────────────────┐
│ Intent Metadata Layer (IML) │
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Semantic Mapping Layer (SML)│
├─────────────────────────────┤
│ Execution Layer (EL)        │
└─────────────────────────────┘
```

- Synchronized views across layers
