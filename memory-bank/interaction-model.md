# Interaction Model Update Log

## [2025-04-11] Material Changes: Execution Metadata in Developer Experience

### Summary of Changes:
- ANRF and AI workflows now require explicit handling and surfacing of execution metadata:
  - Execution modes (interpretation, JIT, AOT)
  - Sandboxing and resource limits
  - Runtime policy enforcement (security, access control)
  - Execution hooks for verification and monitoring

### Developer Experience Requirements:
- Interfaces must allow developers to:
  - View and understand execution metadata for any ANRF instance.
  - Select or override execution mode and resource limits where permitted.
  - Inspect and modify runtime policies and security settings.
  - Attach, review, and manage execution hooks for verification and monitoring.
- Visualizations and information architecture must:
  - Clearly indicate execution mode, sandboxing status, and policy enforcement.
  - Provide warnings or guidance when execution settings may impact security, performance, or correctness.
  - Support drill-down from high-level views to detailed execution metadata.
- Feedback and control mechanisms must:
  - Allow developers to provide feedback on execution settings and outcomes.
  - Enable safe intervention, rollback, or override of AI-suggested execution configurations.
  - Log all changes to execution metadata for auditability and trust.

### Cascade Validation Required:
- Update visualization-framework.md to specify visual indicators and navigation for execution metadata.
- Update control-framework.md to define override, intervention, and rollback mechanisms.
- Update workflow-design.md to integrate execution metadata management into developer task flows.
- Update transparency-patterns.md to ensure AI decisions about execution settings are explainable.
- Update feedback-mechanisms.md to capture developer input on execution configuration and outcomes.

### Next Steps:
- Flag these requirements for cascade review by:
  - Visualization and control framework designers
  - Workflow and feedback system architects
  - Tool ecosystem engineers
