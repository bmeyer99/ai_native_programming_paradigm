# CI/CD Pipeline Update Log

## [2025-04-11] Material Changes: Execution Metadata and Tooling Integration

### Summary of Changes:
- The ANRF and execution model now require CI/CD and tooling to:
  - Validate and enforce execution modes (interpretation, JIT, AOT) as part of build and deployment.
  - Check and propagate sandboxing and resource limits for all execution artifacts.
  - Enforce runtime policy compliance (security, access control) during pipeline stages.
  - Surface and manage execution hooks for verification and monitoring in CI/CD workflows.
  - Provide clear feedback to developers on execution metadata status, warnings, and policy violations.

### Tooling and Pipeline Requirements:
- CI/CD tools must:
  - Parse and validate execution metadata in ANRF artifacts at each pipeline stage.
  - Block or warn on missing/invalid execution mode, sandboxing, or policy fields.
  - Integrate with developer feedback and override mechanisms for execution configuration.
  - Log all changes and enforcement actions for auditability and compliance.
  - Support visualization and reporting of execution metadata in build reports and dashboards.

### Cascade Validation Required:
- Update version-control-design.md to track semantic changes to execution metadata.
- Update debugging-framework.md and testing-approach.md to support execution mode and policy-aware debugging/testing.
- Update documentation-system.md to capture execution metadata and enforcement status.
- Update performance-profiling.md to profile and report on resource limits and sandboxing effectiveness.
- Update tool-integration.md to ensure all tools can read, write, and enforce execution metadata.

### Next Steps:
- Flag these requirements for cascade review by:
  - Version control, debugging, testing, documentation, and profiling tool designers
  - Tool integration architects
