# AI-Native Programming Paradigm Project Roadmap

## Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation and Research

### Active Milestones
- Establishing theoretical framework
- Developing initial proof-of-concept
- Researching existing technologies

### Phase Status
**Start Date:** April 6, 2025
**Current Stage:** Initial Project Setup and Planning
**Key Objectives:** 
- Define conceptual model for AI-native programming
- Research existing intermediate representations
- Identify optimization opportunities
- Determine communication protocols

### Next Major Milestones
1. Complete theoretical framework documentation
2. Identify key existing technologies to build upon
3. Define proof-of-concept scope and requirements

### Dependencies and Critical Path
1. Theoretical framework must be established before:
   - AI code generation research
   - Optimized code representation design
   - Human interface development

2. Existing technology evaluation must be completed before:
