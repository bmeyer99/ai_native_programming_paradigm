# AI-Native Programming Paradigm Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The AI-Native Programming Paradigm aims to revolutionize software development by eliminating the inefficiency of generating human-readable code as an intermediary step. Instead, this paradigm enables AI to directly produce highly optimized machine code while providing on-demand human-readable representations when needed.

## Current Status: Foundation Development
We are currently in Phase 1: Foundation and Research, focusing on establishing the theoretical framework, AI architecture, and interface design for the paradigm.

### Active Development Areas
1. **Theoretical Framework**: Formal model defined, representation format in progress
2. **AI Architecture**: Capability assessment completed, system design in progress
3. **Interface Design**: Interface framework completed, adoption strategy in progress

### Recent Milestones
- ✓ Formal spaces model (I, R, H) with transformations (Gen, Opt, View)
- ✓ AI architecture specification with hybrid model approach
- ✓ Interface framework with multi-modal intent expression and multi-layer views
