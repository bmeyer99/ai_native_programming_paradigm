## Risk Management

### Key Risks
1. **Technical Complexity**: The integration of multiple advanced components may introduce unexpected challenges.
   - Mitigation: Phased approach with internal testing before wider release.

2. **Developer Adoption**: Resistance to new paradigm due to learning curve or skepticism.
   - Mitigation: Comprehensive change management and training approach.

3. **AI Capability Limitations**: Current AI models may not meet all requirements.
   - Mitigation: Tiered approach with progressive enhancement as AI capabilities improve.

4. **Integration Challenges**: Connecting with existing development ecosystems may be complex.
   - Mitigation: Focus on interoperability and migration paths from traditional approaches.
