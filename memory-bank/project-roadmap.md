# AI-Native Programming Paradigm Project Roadmap

## Project Overview
The AI-Native Programming Paradigm aims to revolutionize software development by eliminating the inefficiency of generating human-readable code as an intermediary step. Instead, this paradigm enables AI to directly produce highly optimized machine code while providing on-demand human-readable representations when needed.

## Current Status: Foundation Development
We are currently in Phase 1: Foundation and Research, focusing on establishing the theoretical framework, AI architecture, and interface design for the paradigm.
