│ SECURITY RATIONALE EXPLANATION                              │

│ Memory Safety Rationale:                                    │
│ Memory safety is enforced by default to prevent common      │
│ vulnerabilities like buffer overflows, use-after-free, and  │
│ other memory corruption issues that account for over 70% of │
│ critical security vulnerabilities in traditional code.      │
│                                                             │
│ This function uses SafeBuffer for all memory operations,    │
│ which provides automatic bounds checking and prevents       │
│ unauthorized memory access.                                 │
│                                                             │
│ Resource Constraint Rationale:                              │
│ Resource constraints are applied to prevent denial of       │
│ service attacks and ensure predictable performance. The     │
│ constraints were determined based on:                       │
│ - Typical input data size analysis                          │
│ - Performance profiling of normal operation                 │
│ - Safety margin for unexpected conditions                   │
│                                                             │
│ Isolation Rationale:                                        │
│ Isolation is enforced to contain potential security issues  │
│ and limit the impact of any successful attacks. This        │
│ function only needs read-only access to process input data, │
│ so network access and write permissions are restricted.     │
│                                                             │

## 8. Conclusion

This transparency framework establishes security explanation as a core component of the AI-Native Programming Paradigm. By providing clear, comprehensive explanations of security properties, rationale, alternatives, and impact, we ensure that developers understand the security implications of their code and can make informed decisions about security trade-offs when necessary.

The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with the development environment and to support a wide range of explanation needs, from high-level security status overview to detailed security property exploration. The accessibility considerations ensure that the security explanations are usable by all developers, regardless of their abilities or preferences.
