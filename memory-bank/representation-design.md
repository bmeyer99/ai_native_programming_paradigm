# AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF)

## Overview

The AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF) is a multi-level, layered intermediate representation designed specifically for AI-generated and AI-manipulated code. It balances machine optimization with semantic preservation and human understandability, serving as the canonical representation (`R`) in the formal mathematical framework of the AI-Native Programming Paradigm.

## Design Philosophy

ANRF is built on three core principles:

1. **Semantic Preservation**: Maintaining a complete and accurate mapping between human intent and executable code
2. **Optimization Flexibility**: Enabling aggressive optimizations while preserving semantic equivalence
3. **Multi-level Representation**: Supporting multiple abstraction levels within a unified framework

## Layered Architecture

ANRF employs a tri-layered architecture where each layer serves a distinct purpose but maintains bidirectional references to the others:

1. **Execution Layer (EL)**: The lowest level, focused on efficient execution
2. **Semantic Mapping Layer (SML)**: The middle layer, maintaining semantic relationships
3. **Intent Metadata Layer (IML)**: The highest level, preserving human intent and design rationale

### Layer Relationships

```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│ Intent Metadata Layer   │ ← Human intent, design rationale, constraints
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Semantic Mapping Layer  │ ← Semantic relationships, type information
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Execution Layer         │ ← Optimized for machine execution
└─────────────────────────┘
```

Each layer can be processed independently but maintains bidirectional references to preserve semantic coherence across transformations.

## Core Components

### 1. Execution Layer (EL)

The Execution Layer is a graph-based representation optimized for efficient execution:

- **Nodes**: Represent computational operations
- **Edges**: Represent data and control flow
- **Properties**:
  - Static Single Assignment (SSA) form
  - Explicit type information
  - Memory access model
  - Control flow primitives

The EL is inspired by LLVM IR and MLIR but extends them with AI-specific optimizations and metadata hooks.

### 2. Semantic Mapping Layer (SML)

The Semantic Mapping Layer maintains the relationships between program elements:

- **Entity Map**: Maps program entities (variables, functions, types) to their semantic meanings
- **Relationship Graph**: Captures relationships between entities (uses, dependencies, etc.)
- **Transformation History**: Records the sequence of transformations applied during optimization
- **Verification Conditions**: Formal conditions that must be preserved during transformations

### 3. Intent Metadata Layer (IML)

The Intent Metadata Layer preserves human intent and design rationale:

- **Intent Annotations**: Captures the purpose and constraints of code elements
- **Design Rationale**: Documents why specific implementation choices were made
- **Domain Knowledge**: Encodes domain-specific information relevant to the code
- **Natural Language Descriptions**: Human-readable explanations of code functionality

## Cross-Layer References

ANRF uses a bidirectional reference system to maintain coherence across layers:

- **Forward References**: Links from higher to lower layers (intent → semantics → execution)
- **Backward References**: Links from lower to higher layers (execution → semantics → intent)
- **Reference Types**:
  - **Direct**: One-to-one mappings between elements
  - **Compositional**: One-to-many or many-to-one mappings
  - **Constraint**: Relationships that enforce invariants across layers

## Formal Representation

ANRF can be formally represented as:

```
ANRF = (EL, SML, IML, FR, BR)
```

Where:
- `EL`: Execution Layer
- `SML`: Semantic Mapping Layer
- `IML`: Intent Metadata Layer
- `FR`: Forward References
- `BR`: Backward References

### Execution Layer

```
EL = (N, E, T, C)
```

Where:
- `N`: Set of computational nodes
- `E`: Set of data and control flow edges
- `T`: Type system
- `C`: Control flow graph

### Semantic Mapping Layer

```
SML = (EM, RG, TH, VC)
```

Where:
- `EM`: Entity map
- `RG`: Relationship graph
- `TH`: Transformation history
- `VC`: Verification conditions

### Intent Metadata Layer

```
IML = (IA, DR, DK, NL)
```

Where:
- `IA`: Intent annotations
- `DR`: Design rationale
- `DK`: Domain knowledge
- `NL`: Natural language descriptions

## Serialization Format

ANRF uses a hybrid serialization approach:

1. **Binary Format**: For efficient storage and processing of the Execution Layer
2. **Structured Format**: JSON-based format for the Semantic Mapping Layer
3. **Rich Text Format**: For the Intent Metadata Layer, supporting markdown and structured annotations

The serialized format includes a header with version information and layer offsets, followed by the serialized content of each layer and the cross-layer references.

## Operations and Transformations

ANRF supports several key operations:

1. **Generation (`Gen`)**: Creating ANRF from human intent
2. **Optimization (`Opt`)**: Transforming ANRF to improve execution efficiency
3. **Viewing (`View`)**: Generating human-readable representations from ANRF
4. **Verification (`Verify`)**: Checking semantic preservation across transformations

### Optimization Transformations

Optimizations in ANRF primarily target the Execution Layer but must maintain the cross-layer references:

1. **Local Optimizations**: Peephole optimizations, constant folding, etc.
2. **Global Optimizations**: Dead code elimination, loop optimizations, etc.
3. **Specialization**: Target-specific optimizations
4. **Parallelization**: Identifying and exploiting parallelism

Each optimization must preserve the semantic equivalence as defined by the formal framework.

## Verification Mechanisms

ANRF includes built-in verification mechanisms:

1. **Structural Verification**: Ensuring the well-formedness of the representation
2. **Semantic Verification**: Checking semantic preservation using the formal definitions
3. **Cross-Layer Consistency**: Verifying the consistency of references across layers
4. **Transformation Correctness**: Ensuring that transformations preserve semantics

## Evolution and Extensibility

ANRF is designed for evolution and extensibility:

1. **Version Control**: Explicit versioning of the format specification
2. **Extension Points**: Well-defined points for extending the format
3. **Dialect Mechanism**: Support for domain-specific dialects (similar to MLIR)
4. **Compatibility Layer**: Mechanisms for backward compatibility

## Integration with Existing Systems

ANRF provides integration paths with existing systems:

1. **Import/Export**: Conversion to/from existing IRs (LLVM IR, MLIR, etc.)
2. **Execution Bridge**: Direct execution through JIT compilation or interpretation
3. **Development Tool Integration**: APIs for IDEs, debuggers, and other development tools
4. **Legacy Code Integration**: Mechanisms for integrating with legacy codebases
