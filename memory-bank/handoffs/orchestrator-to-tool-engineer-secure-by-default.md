[DIRECTIVE TO: Tool Ecosystem Engineer]

[CONTEXT: The secure-by-default implementation has progressed through multiple specialist roles, with the Systems Architect designing the overall architecture, the Language Designer updating the ANRF format, the AI Integration Specialist creating the AI security framework, and most recently the Developer Experience Designer completing the security visualization and override UI designs. The Developer Experience Designer has provided detailed UI specifications for implementing security visualization, override workflows, and explanation interfaces in IDE plugins and development tools. The implementation is now at a critical stage where these designs need to be transformed into working tools that developers can use.]

[TASK: Implement the security visualization, override workflow, and explanation interfaces in IDE plugins and development tools based on the Developer Experience Designer's specifications. Create a comprehensive verification tool suite that integrates with the IDE and CI/CD pipeline to enforce the secure-by-default approach. Develop debugging support for security issues and documentation generation for security properties.]

[CONSIDERATIONS:]
- The Developer Experience Designer has provided detailed UI specifications in memory-bank/handoffs/dx-designer-to-tool-engineer-secure-by-default.md, including component designs, integration points, implementation guidelines, and example implementations
- The AI Integration Specialist has provided verification integration specifications in memory-bank/handoffs/ai-integration-specialist-to-tool-engineer-secure-by-default.md
- The security visualization must clearly communicate security status through badges, property indicators, layer visualization, and code annotations
- The override workflow must support request formulation, justification, approval, and monitoring
- The explanation interfaces must provide clear, progressive disclosure of security information
- The implementation must balance security visibility with usability and performance
- The tools must integrate with existing development environments including IDEs, version control systems, and CI/CD pipelines
- Accessibility must be considered throughout the implementation
- The implementation should be extensible to support future security properties and verification approaches

[EXPECTED OUTCOME:]
- Working IDE plugins for major development environments (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc.) that implement security visualization, override workflow, and explanation interfaces
- CI/CD pipeline integration that enforces security gates and validates overrides
- Verification tool suite that checks security properties and integrates with the IDE and CI/CD pipeline
- Debugging support for security issues that helps developers identify and fix security problems
- Documentation generation for security properties that creates clear, comprehensive documentation
- Performance optimization for security visualization and verification to minimize impact on development workflow
- Comprehensive test suite that validates the implementation against the specifications

[HANDOFF GUIDANCE:]
- Upon completion, provide a detailed implementation report to the Paradigm Orchestrator
- Coordinate with the Implementation Strategist on migration guidance for existing code
- Provide technical specifications to the Theoretical Computer Scientist for formal validation
- Share implementation details with the Developer Experience Designer for UX validation
- Identify any open challenges or areas for improvement that should be addressed in future iterations
