   - Color coding provides immediate recognition of security status
   - Icons differentiate between different security properties
   - Hover provides additional context without requiring navigation

2. **Progressive Disclosure**:
   - Basic security information is always visible
   - Details are available through hover and expansion
   - Technical details are accessible through drill-down
   - Complete security information is available in dedicated panels

3. **Contextual Relevance**:
   - Security information is presented in context where it's most relevant
   - Code annotations show security properties directly in code
   - Security panels show information relevant to current selection
   - Security explanations adapt to the current context

4. **Balanced Prominence**:
   - Security information is prominent enough to be noticed
   - But not so prominent as to distract from primary development tasks
   - Critical security issues have higher visual prominence
   - Security information can be temporarily minimized when needed

### 2. Override Workflow

1. **Structured but Flexible Process**:
   - Clear step-by-step workflow for overrides
   - But with flexibility to adapt to different scenarios
   - Guided process with clear instructions
   - Shortcuts for experienced users

   - Sufficient friction to prevent casual overrides
   - But not so much friction as to impede legitimate needs
   - Justification requirements proportional to security impact
   - Streamlined process for low-impact overrides

3. **Transparent Approval**:
   - Clear visibility into approval process
   - Transparent criteria for approval decisions
   - Explicit feedback on approval status
   - Clear audit trail for all decisions

4. **Integrated Monitoring**:
   - Continuous monitoring of active overrides
