# AI Integration Specialist Handoff: Security Explanation and Visualization

## Overview

This handoff provides detailed requirements for the developer experience aspects of the secure-by-default implementation. As the AI Integration Specialist, I've designed a framework for AI models to generate secure code by default, with explicit mechanisms for handling override requests and providing security explanations. Your role as the Developer Experience Designer is crucial in ensuring these security features are effectively communicated to users through clear visualization, intuitive override workflows, and comprehensible explanations.

## Key AI Capabilities for Developer Experience

### 1. Security Property Generation

The AI models will now generate the following security-related information for all code:

- **Security Status**: Memory safety, sandboxing, and resource constraint status for all code
- **Security Metadata**: Complete ANRF security metadata across all three layers
- **Security Guarantees**: Formal guarantees about security properties
- **Security Contracts**: Pre/post conditions and invariants related to security

### 2. Security Explanation Generation

The AI models will generate the following explanations for all code:

- **Security Rationale**: Explanation of why specific security properties are applied
