# AI Integration Specialist Handoff: Security Verification Integration

## Overview

This handoff provides detailed requirements for the tool ecosystem aspects of the secure-by-default implementation. As the AI Integration Specialist, I've designed a framework for AI models to generate secure code by default, with integrated verification throughout the generation pipeline. Your role as the Tool Ecosystem Engineer is crucial in creating the verification tools and integration points that will ensure all generated code meets the secure-by-default requirements.
