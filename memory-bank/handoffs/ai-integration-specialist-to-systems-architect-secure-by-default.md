# AI Integration Specialist Handoff: AI-Execution Model Integration for Secure-by-Default

## Overview

This handoff provides detailed requirements for the integration between AI models and the execution model for the secure-by-default implementation. As the AI Integration Specialist, I've designed a framework for AI models to generate secure code by default, with explicit mechanisms for handling override requests and providing security explanations. Your role as the Systems Architect is crucial in ensuring that the execution model properly enforces these security properties and integrates seamlessly with the AI generation pipeline.

## Key AI Capabilities for Execution Integration

### 1. Security Metadata Generation

The AI models will generate the following security metadata for execution:

- **Safety Level Specification**: Memory safety, type safety, and resource bound levels

- **Security Enforcement Mechanisms**: Memory safety mechanisms and sandboxing techniques
- **Override Information**: Override status, justification, and approval details

### 2. Security Verification Integration

The AI models will integrate with verification in the following ways:

- **Pre-Execution Verification**: Verification before execution to confirm security properties
