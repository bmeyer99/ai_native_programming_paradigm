# Open Questions

This document catalogs unresolved challenges and questions requiring attention in the AI-Native Programming Paradigm development.

## Security and Execution

### Secure-by-Default Implementation Challenges

**Status**: Active
**Assigned To**: Systems Architect (primary), cross-specialist collaboration
**Created**: 2025-04-11

**Questions**:

1. **Performance Impact**:
   - How significant will the performance overhead be for enforcing memory safety and sandboxing by default?
   - What optimizations can mitigate this overhead without compromising security?
   - Should different execution modes (Interpretation, JIT, AOT) have different security enforcement mechanisms?

2. **Override Mechanism Design**:
   - What is the appropriate granularity for override controls (per function, module, project)?
   - How should override justifications be structured to ensure meaningful documentation?
   - What audit trail is needed for security overrides?
   - Should overrides require approval in team settings?

3. **Migration Strategy**:
   - How should existing code be handled during migration to secure-by-default?
   - Should there be a grace period with warnings before strict enforcement?
   - What tooling is needed to assist developers in identifying and fixing unsafe code?

4. **Security Verification**:
   - What verification techniques are most effective for confirming memory safety?
   - How can verification be performed efficiently without excessive runtime overhead?
   - What formal guarantees can be provided about the security properties?

5. **Developer Experience**:
   - How can we design the security UI to be informative without being intrusive?
   - What is the right balance between security enforcement and developer productivity?
   - How should security status be visualized across the three-layer architecture?

**Next Steps**:
1. Systems Architect to provide initial answers as part of execution model updates
2. Cross-specialist review to refine answers from respective domains
3. Integration into secure-by-default implementation plan

## Execution Model

### Runtime Integration Challenges

**Status**: Active
**Assigned To**: Systems Architect
**Created**: 2025-04-11

**Questions**:

1. **Cross-Platform Consistency**:
   - How can we ensure consistent execution behavior across different platforms?
   - What abstractions are needed to handle platform-specific differences?
   - How should platform capabilities be exposed to the ANRF?

2. **Versioning and Compatibility**:
   - How should the execution model handle versioning of ANRF instances?
   - What backward compatibility guarantees should be provided?
   - How can execution environments support multiple ANRF versions simultaneously?

3. **Resource Management**:
   - What resource allocation and management strategies should be employed?
   - How should resource limits be determined and enforced?
   - What happens when resource limits are exceeded?

4. **Error Handling**:
   - How should runtime errors be represented and communicated?
   - What error recovery mechanisms should be provided?
   - How can errors be mapped back to the intent and semantic layers?

**Next Steps**:
1. Systems Architect to address these questions in the execution model documentation
2. Theoretical Computer Scientist to validate formal properties of error handling
3. Developer Experience Designer to design error visualization and recovery interfaces

## Phase 1 Implementation

### Phase 1 Open Questions

**Status**: Active
**Assigned To**: Paradigm Orchestrator (coordination), All Specialists
**Created**: 2025-04-07

**Questions**:

1. **Scaling approach for larger teams**:
   - How should the paradigm scale beyond the initial 5-7 team members?
   - What additional coordination mechanisms are needed for larger teams?
   - How can knowledge sharing be facilitated across team boundaries?

2. **Integration with existing codebases**:
   - What strategies should be employed for integrating with existing code?
   - How should ANRF instances reference external code?
   - What migration paths should be provided for converting existing code to ANRF?

3. **Performance optimization for complex ANRF instances**:
   - How can performance be optimized for large or complex ANRF instances?
   - What caching strategies should be employed?
   - How can optimization be balanced with semantic preservation?

4. **Enhanced debugging and testing strategies**:
   - What debugging techniques are most effective for the three-layer architecture?
   - How can tests be written and executed across the layers?
   - What visualization approaches best support debugging workflows?

**Next Steps**:
1. Address these questions during Phase 1 implementation
2. Collect feedback from dogfooding team
3. Incorporate solutions into Phase 2 planning
