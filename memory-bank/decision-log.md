# Decision Log

This document records major decisions and their rationales for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm development.

## 2025-04-07: Phase 1 Execution Planning Completion

**Decision**: Finalize and approve the comprehensive Phase 1 (Internal Dogfooding) execution plan.

**Components**:
1. Technical Specifications (Systems Architect)
2. AI Model Development and Training Plan (AI Integration Specialist)
3. Stable v1 ANRF Format Specification (Language Designer)
4. UX Implementation Specifications (Developer Experience Designer)
5. Tool Development Plan (Tool Ecosystem Engineer)
6. Core Team Selection and Onboarding Plan (Implementation Strategist)

**Rationale**:
- All specialist contributions have been completed and integrated
- Dependencies between components have been identified and resolved
- The plan provides a comprehensive approach for the Internal Dogfooding phase
- The three-layer ANRF architecture (Intent, Semantic, Execution) is consistently supported across all components
- The progressive disclosure approach in the UX design aligns with the onboarding strategy
- The tool development timeline aligns with the AI model training and team onboarding schedules

**Implementation Timeline**:
- Month 1: AI model training, tool development initiation, team selection
- Month 2: Tool development continuation, team onboarding preparation
- Month 3: Tool completion, team onboarding, initial usage
- Month 4: Feedback collection, refinement, preparation for Phase 2

**Success Metrics**:
- Completion of all technical components according to specifications
- Successful onboarding of 5-7 team members
- Generation of at least 100 ANRF instances during dogfooding
- Collection of comprehensive feedback for Phase 2 planning

**Open Questions for Phase 2**:
- Scaling approach for larger teams
- Integration with existing codebases
- Performance optimization for complex ANRF instances
- Enhanced debugging and testing strategies

## 2025-04-06: Adoption of Three-Layer Architecture

**Decision**: Adopt a three-layer architecture (Intent, Semantic, Execution) for the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF).

**Rationale**:
- Aligns with the formal mathematical framework's spaces (Intent `I`, Representation `R`, Human View `H`)
- Separates concerns while maintaining bidirectional references
- Enables optimization at the execution layer while preserving semantic information
- Supports progressive disclosure in the user experience
- Facilitates verification through cross-layer validation

**Implementation Approach**:
- Protocol Buffers serialization for efficient binary representation
- Clear metadata schema for semantic preservation
- Bidirectional references between layers
- Validation rules for structural, semantic, and cross-layer integrity

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single-layer representation with embedded metadata (rejected due to limited optimization potential)
- Two-layer approach without intent layer (rejected due to loss of original intent information)
- Custom binary format (rejected in favor of Protocol Buffers for better language support)

## 2025-04-05: Phase 1 Scope Definition

**Decision**: Define Phase 1 (Internal Dogfooding) scope to focus on basic code generation, modification, review, and debugging workflows.

**Rationale**:
- Provides essential functionality for initial testing
- Focuses on core user journeys for maximum feedback value
- Manageable scope for the initial implementation
- Covers the full lifecycle of ANRF instances
- Enables meaningful validation of the paradigm's core concepts

**Implementation Approach**:
- IDE plugin with layer-based visualization
- Support for the three-layer ANRF architecture
- Basic validation and confidence scoring
- Progressive disclosure of complexity
- Comprehensive onboarding and feedback collection

**Deferred Features**:
- Advanced optimization techniques
- Complex refactoring workflows
- Cross-module changes
- Custom visualization modes
- Advanced debugging features
