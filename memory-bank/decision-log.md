# Decision Log

This document records major decisions made during the development of the AI-Native Programming Paradigm and their rationales.

## Three-Layer Execution Model

**Decision Date**: 2025-03-15

**Decision**: Adopt a three-layer execution model (Intent, Semantic, Execution) rather than a two-layer model (Intent, Execution).

**Rationale**:
- The semantic layer provides a critical optimization target that balances human understandability and machine optimizability
- Direct transformation from intent to execution is too complex and opaque
- The semantic layer enables more powerful and transparent optimizations
- Bidirectional traceability is easier to maintain with an intermediate layer

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Two-layer model with direct intent-to-execution transformation
- Multiple semantic layers with different levels of abstraction

**Impact**:
- Increased complexity in the representation format
- More sophisticated transformation framework required
- Enhanced optimization capabilities
- Improved traceability and transparency

## Semantic Primacy

**Decision Date**: 2025-03-15

**Decision**: Establish the semantic layer as the source of truth, with intent and execution layers derived from it.

**Rationale**:
- The semantic layer provides the optimal balance between human understandability and machine optimizability
- Having a single source of truth simplifies consistency management
- The semantic layer can capture both intent and execution concerns
- Bidirectional derivation enables both top-down and bottom-up development

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Intent layer as source of truth
- Execution layer as source of truth
- Multiple sources of truth with reconciliation mechanisms

**Impact**:
- Tools must operate primarily on the semantic layer
- Verification focuses on semantic correctness
- Transformations must maintain semantic integrity
- Developer experience must provide intuitive access to the semantic layer

## AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF)

**Decision Date**: 2025-03-20

**Decision**: Create a new representation format (ANRF) specifically designed for AI-native programming rather than extending existing formats.

**Rationale**:
- Existing formats are optimized for human-written code, not AI-generated code
- A new format can be designed from the ground up for the three-layer model
- ANRF can incorporate rich metadata for optimization and verification
- A purpose-built format enables more powerful transformations and optimizations

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Extending existing formats like ASTs or IRs
- Using multiple existing formats for different layers
- Creating a meta-format that wraps existing formats

**Impact**:
- Increased development effort to create a new format
- Need for interoperability with existing formats
- Enhanced capabilities for AI-native programming
- Potential for broader ecosystem adoption

## Secure-by-Default Approach

**Decision Date**: 2025-04-05

**Decision**: Implement a secure-by-default approach where memory safety, resource constraints, and sandboxing are enforced by default, with explicit, justified, and approved overrides for exceptions.

**Rationale**:
- Security should not be an optional feature or afterthought
- Making security the default eliminates entire classes of vulnerabilities
- Explicit overrides ensure that security exceptions are deliberate and justified
- A secure-by-default approach aligns with industry best practices and regulatory trends
- The AI-Native Programming Paradigm has a unique opportunity to establish security as a fundamental property

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Opt-in security model where developers explicitly enable security features
- Tiered security model with different default levels for different contexts
- Security as a separate concern managed independently from functionality
- Gradual adoption of secure-by-default with legacy compatibility modes

**Impact**:
- Comprehensive updates required across all components of the paradigm
- Enhanced security guarantees for all code
- Potential performance impact that must be mitigated
- Developer workflow changes, particularly around security overrides
- Need for clear security visualization, explanation, and documentation
- Integration challenges with existing codebases and tools

## Comprehensive Tool Ecosystem Integration

**Decision Date**: 2025-04-11

**Decision**: Fully integrate the secure-by-default approach across the entire tool ecosystem, including visualization, debugging, testing, documentation, and CI/CD.

**Rationale**:
- Security must be enforced and visible throughout the development lifecycle
- Developers need comprehensive tools to understand and work with security properties
- Consistent security enforcement across tools prevents security gaps
- Integrated security tools reduce the burden on developers while improving security

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Security-specific tools separate from the main development tools
- Gradual integration of security features into tools
- Third-party security tools with integration points

**Impact**:
- Comprehensive updates to all development tools
- Enhanced security visibility and enforcement
- Consistent security experience across the development lifecycle
- Potential complexity in tool implementation and integration
- Need for standardized security interfaces and metadata
