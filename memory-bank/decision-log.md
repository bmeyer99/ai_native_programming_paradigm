**Status**: In Progress

**Context**:
The representation format is a critical integration point between all components.

**Alternatives Considered**:
1. Binary-only format with minimal metadata
2. Human-readable intermediate format
3. Multiple specialized formats for different domains

**Decision Rationale**:
