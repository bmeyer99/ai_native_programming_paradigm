# System Architecture for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview
This document outlines the technical architecture for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm. It adopts a service-oriented approach to provide flexibility, scalability, and modularity. The architecture supports the generation, optimization, verification, execution, and visualization of the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF).

## Core Architectural Principles
1.  **Service-Oriented**: Key functionalities (generation, optimization, verification, etc.) are exposed as independent services.
2.  **Layered ANRF**: Architecture supports the layered nature of ANRF, allowing separate processing of execution, semantic, and intent layers while maintaining linkage.
3.  **API-Driven**: Interactions between components and external tools are managed through well-defined APIs.
4.  **Scalability**: Designed for horizontal scaling to handle varying loads.
5.  **Extensibility**: Allows for the addition of new AI models, optimization techniques, and verification methods.
6.  **Interoperability**: Provides interfaces for integration with existing development ecosystems (IDEs, CI/CD, version control).
7.  **Security**: Incorporates security considerations at all levels.

*   **API Gateway**: Single entry point for all service requests, handling authentication, routing, and rate limiting. (e.g., AWS API Gateway, Kong, Nginx)
*   **Intent Analysis Service**: Processes developer intent (natural language, specs) and translates it into a structured format for generation. (Tech: Python/FastAPI, NLP libs like spaCy/Hugging Face Transformers)
*   **Generation Service**: Takes structured intent and generates initial ANRF instances using AI models. Provides confidence scores. (Tech: Python/PyTorch/TensorFlow, specialized models)
*   **Optimization Service**: Applies optimization techniques to ANRF instances, preserving semantics. (Tech: C++/LLVM-like framework, rule-based systems)
*   **Verification Service**: Verifies ANRF properties, checks constraints, performs semantic equivalence checks, and integrates formal methods. Provides tiered verification results. (Tech: Python/Z3, formal method tools interface)
*   **Viewing Service**: Translates ANRF into human-readable formats (code, diagrams) based on developer requests and abstraction levels. (Tech: Node.js/Express, graph visualization libs)
*   **Execution Service/Runtime Interface**: Interfaces with target execution environments or provides a runtime for executing ANRF. (Tech: Depends on target - e.g., WASM runtime, JVM interface, native compiler backend)
*   **ANRF Registry/Storage**: Persistent storage for ANRF instances and their versions. (Tech: Object storage like S3, specialized binary format storage, potentially Git LFS integration)
*   **Metadata Database**: Stores semantic linkage, intent mapping, verification results, and other metadata associated with ANRF instances. (Tech: Graph Database like Neo4j, or Document DB like MongoDB)
*   **AI Model Registry**: Stores and versions AI models used by the services. (Tech: MLflow, SageMaker Model Registry, Vertex AI Model Registry)
