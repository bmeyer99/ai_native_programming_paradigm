# System Architecture for AI-Native Programming Paradigm (v2 - Incorporating Practical Constraints)

## Overview

This document outlines the technical architecture for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm, focusing on the components required to support the generation, storage, manipulation, execution, and human interaction with the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF). This version incorporates refinements based on practical constraints identified during implementation planning. The architecture prioritizes modularity, performance, scalability, security, extensibility, **verifiability**, and **support for gradual adoption**.

## Core Architectural Principles

1.  **Service-Oriented**: Decompose functionality into distinct, interoperable services.
2.  **Layered Representation**: Directly support the tri-layered ANRF structure (EL, SML, IML).
3.  **Asynchronous Communication**: Utilize message queues or event buses for inter-service communication where appropriate to enhance scalability and resilience.
4.  **State Management**: Centralize or effectively distribute state management for consistency.
5.  **Extensibility**: Design for easy integration of new AI models, representation features, and interaction modalities.
6.  **Performance**: Optimize critical paths for real-time interaction and efficient batch processing, mitigating ANRF overhead.
7.  **Security**: Integrate security considerations at all levels, including validation of AI outputs.
8.  **Verifiability**: Architect components to support modular and incremental verification processes.
9.  **Interoperability**: Design explicit interfaces for integration with legacy systems and existing toolchains.
