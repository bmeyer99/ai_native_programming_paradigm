# Visualization Framework for ANRF

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-04-11)

This document defines the visualization framework for the AI-Native Representation Format (ANRF), with a focus on the secure-by-default approach. It specifies how code is represented visually to humans, including security status visualization.

## 1. Overview

The visualization framework provides a comprehensive approach to representing ANRF code visually to humans. With the secure-by-default approach, security visualization is now a core component of the framework, ensuring that security status is clearly communicated to developers.

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Multi-level Abstraction**: Visualizations must support multiple levels of detail and abstraction
- **Semantic Preservation**: Visual representations must preserve semantic meaning
- **Security Transparency**: Security status must be clearly visible at all levels
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Details should be revealed progressively based on context and need
- **Consistency**: Visual language should be consistent across all views and components

### 1.2 Visualization Layers

The visualization framework consists of four interconnected layers:

- **Overview Layer**: High-level visualization of the entire codebase or module
- **Intent Layer**: Visualization of high-level intent and requirements
- **Semantic Layer**: Visualization of semantic meaning and relationships
- **Execution Layer**: Visualization of execution details and runtime behavior

## 2. Security Status Visualization

### 2.1 Security Status Indicators

Security status is visualized through a consistent system of indicators:

1. **Status Badge System**:
   - **Secure Badge**: Green shield icon for code that meets all security requirements
   - **Override Badge**: Yellow shield with exclamation mark for code with security overrides
   - **Warning Badge**: Orange shield with warning symbol for code with potential security issues
   - **Insecure Badge**: Red shield with X for code with security violations

2. **Color Coding System**:
   - **Green**: Fully secure code (memory safe, properly sandboxed, resource bounded)
   - **Yellow**: Code with explicit security overrides
   - **Orange**: Code with potential security issues or unverified security properties
   - **Red**: Code with security violations or missing required security properties

3. **Security Property Icons**:
   - **Memory Safety Icon**: Shield with "M" for memory safety status
   - **Sandboxing Icon**: Box with lock for isolation status
   - **Resource Bounds Icon**: Gauge for resource constraint status
   - **Verification Icon**: Checkmark for verification status

4. **Status Severity Indicators**:
   - **Border Thickness**: Thicker borders for more critical security properties
   - **Pulsing Animation**: Subtle pulsing for unaddressed security issues
   - **Opacity Variation**: Full opacity for active issues, reduced opacity for addressed issues
   - **Size Variation**: Larger indicators for more severe security concerns

### 2.2 Layer-specific Security Visualization

Each layer of the ANRF has specific security visualization approaches:

1. **Intent Layer Security Visualization**:
   - Security requirements highlighted with security icons
   - Security intentions displayed with clear visual emphasis
   - Override intentions marked with distinct visual treatment
   - Security constraints visualized with appropriate severity indicators

2. **Semantic Layer Security Visualization**:
   - Entity security properties displayed with property-specific icons

3. **Execution Layer Security Visualization**:
   - Security enforcement mechanisms visualized with mechanism-specific icons
   - Resource requirements displayed with usage gauges
   - Optimization security impact shown with impact indicators

4. **Cross-Layer Security Visualization**:
   - Consistency indicators showing alignment across layers
   - Traceability lines connecting related security elements
   - Aggregated security status showing combined security posture
   - Discrepancy highlights showing inconsistencies between layers

### 2.3 Security Impact Visualization

## 8. Conclusion

This visualization framework establishes security visualization as a core component of the ANRF visualization approach. By providing clear, consistent, and accessible visualization of security status, properties, and impact, we ensure that developers are always aware of the security implications of their code and can make informed decisions about security overrides when necessary.

The framework is designed to integrate seamlessly with the development environment and to support a wide range of visualization needs, from high-level security status overview to detailed security property exploration. The accessibility considerations ensure that the security visualization is usable by all developers, regardless of their visual, cognitive, or physical abilities.
