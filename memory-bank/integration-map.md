# Integration Map

This document maps how different components of the AI-Native Programming Paradigm interact and integrate with each other.

## Security Integration Points

### Secure-by-Default Memory Safety and Sandboxing

**Status**: In Progress (2025-04-11)
**Owner**: Systems Architect

#### Integration with Representation Format (ANRF)

- **Metadata Schema**: 
  - Safety/sandboxing metadata must be encoded as required fields in ANRF
  - Validation rules must enforce safety requirements
  - Bidirectional references must maintain safety context across layers

- **Intent Layer (IML)**:
  - Intent expressions must capture security requirements
  - Security intent must be preserved during transformations
  - Override intentions must be explicitly documented

- **Semantic Layer (SML)**:
  - Semantic constraints must enforce memory safety rules
  - Security properties must be formally represented
  - Cross-references to execution layer must maintain safety context

- **Execution Layer (EL)**:
  - Must implement memory safety mechanisms
  - Must enforce sandboxing boundaries
  - Must respect explicit overrides with appropriate logging

#### Integration with AI Generation

- **Model Training**:
  - Models must be trained to generate memory-safe code by default
  - Training data must include examples of safe code patterns
  - Fine-tuning must reinforce secure-by-default behavior

- **Generation Process**:
  - Generation must include safety checks
  - Confidence scoring must account for security properties
  - Explanations must include security rationale

- **Transformation**:
  - Optimizations must preserve security properties
  - Transformations must not introduce security vulnerabilities
  - Security verification must be performed after transformations

#### Integration with Developer Experience

- **Visualization**:
  - Safety status must be clearly indicated in the UI
  - Override interfaces must require explicit action
  - Security properties must be visible across all layers

- **Editing Workflows**:
  - Edits that compromise safety must trigger warnings
  - Override justifications must be captured during editing
  - Security impact must be shown for all modifications

- **Debugging**:
  - Security violations must be clearly highlighted
  - Debugging tools must respect sandboxing boundaries
  - Security context must be preserved during debugging

#### Integration with Verification

- **Static Analysis**:
  - Verification must treat absence of safety as an error
  - Override justifications must be validated
  - Security properties must be formally verified

- **Runtime Verification**:
  - Execution environment must enforce security boundaries
  - Resource limits must be monitored and enforced
  - Security violations must be logged and reported

- **CI/CD Integration**:
  - Pipeline must enforce security requirements
  - Override approvals must be part of review process
  - Security metrics must be tracked over time

#### Integration with Tooling

- **Version Control**:
  - Security overrides must be tracked in version history
  - Security properties must be preserved during merges
  - Diff visualization must highlight security changes

- **Collaboration Tools**:
  - Security status must be visible in code reviews
  - Override justifications must be reviewable
  - Security changes must require appropriate approvals

- **Documentation**:
  - Security properties must be documented
  - Override justifications must be included in documentation
  - Security guarantees must be clearly communicated

## Execution Model Integration Points

### ANRF Execution Framework

**Status**: Active (2025-04-11)
**Owner**: Systems Architect

#### Integration with Representation Format (ANRF)

- **Execution Layer (EL)**:
  - Execution model directly processes this layer
  - Optimization annotations guide execution strategy
  - Resource requirements are specified here

- **Semantic Layer (SML)**:
  - Semantic constraints guide verification during execution
  - Cross-references enable semantic-aware debugging
  - Invariants and contracts are enforced at runtime

- **Intent Layer (IML)**:
  - Intent provides context for error messages
  - Performance expectations guide optimization strategy
  - User-facing explanations reference intent

#### Integration with AI Services

- **Generation (Gen)**:
  - Generated code must be compatible with execution model
  - Execution feedback informs future generation
  - Performance characteristics guide generation strategy

- **Optimization (Opt)**:
  - Execution model provides optimization targets
  - Runtime profiling guides optimization decisions
  - Execution modes influence optimization strategy

- **Verification (Verify)**:
  - Execution model enforces verified properties
  - Runtime checks complement static verification
  - Verification results guide execution strategy

#### Integration with Developer Tools

- **Debugging**:
  - Execution model provides runtime state for debugging
  - Breakpoints and stepping are integrated with execution
  - Execution context is preserved during debugging

- **Profiling**:
  - Execution model collects performance metrics
  - Resource usage is tracked and reported
  - Bottlenecks are identified for optimization

- **Testing**:
  - Execution model provides test environment
  - Test coverage is measured during execution
  - Test results are linked to execution context
