# Tool Integration for Secure-by-Default

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-04-11)

This document defines the tool integration approach for the AI-Native Programming Paradigm, with a focus on the secure-by-default implementation. It specifies how development tools connect and communicate to enforce and visualize security properties.

## 1. Overview

The secure-by-default approach requires comprehensive tool integration to ensure that security properties are enforced, visualized, and explained throughout the development lifecycle. This document outlines the design of IDE plugins, CI/CD integration, and other development tools that support the secure-by-default approach.

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Seamless Integration**: Security tools must integrate seamlessly with existing development environments
- **Consistent Experience**: Security visualization and interaction must be consistent across tools
- **Appropriate Feedback**: Tools must provide clear, actionable feedback about security properties
- **Balanced Visibility**: Security information must be visible without overwhelming developers
- **Extensible Architecture**: Tool integration must support future security properties and verification approaches

### 1.2 Integration Components

The tool integration framework consists of four interconnected components:

- **IDE Integration**: How security visualization, override workflow, and explanation interfaces integrate with IDEs
- **CI/CD Integration**: How security verification and override validation integrate with CI/CD pipelines
- **Collaboration Tool Integration**: How security information is shared and reviewed in collaboration tools
- **Ecosystem Integration**: How security tools connect with the broader development ecosystem

## 2. Security Visualization Plugin

### 2.1 Design Overview

The Security Visualization Plugin provides a comprehensive visual representation of security properties in the development environment. It integrates with popular IDEs (VS Code, JetBrains IDEs, etc.) to display security status, properties, and impact directly in the editor, enabling developers to understand the security implications of their code at a glance.

### 2.2 Core Functionality

1. **Security Status Visualization**:
   - Security status badges in editor gutter, file explorer, and project overview
