# Tooling Implementation Plan for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Overview
This document outlines the phased implementation plan for integrating AI capabilities into the developer tools supporting the AI-Native Programming Paradigm. It aligns with the AI Capability Roadmap (`model-architecture.md`) and the overall technical implementation plan (`system-architecture.md`).

## Core Developer Tools
1.  **IDE Plugin**: Provides an interface within the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for interacting with AI services (intent input, code generation, verification results, etc.).
2.  **CI/CD Pipeline Integration**: Automates the integration and deployment processes, incorporating AI-driven checks and optimizations.
3.  **Collaboration Tools**: Facilitates team coordination, code review, and feedback collection within the AI-Native development workflow.
4.  **Version Control Integration**: Manages versioning and tracking of non-textual ANRF changes.
5.  **Debugging Tools**: Provides visibility into the behavior of AI-generated code and assists in identifying and fixing issues.
6.  **Testing Framework**: Verifies the correctness and performance of AI-generated code.
7.  **Documentation System**: Captures and shares knowledge about the AI-Native code, including intent, design, and implementation details.
8.  **Performance Profiling Tools**: Analyzes runtime behavior and optimization effectiveness.
