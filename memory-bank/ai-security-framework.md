# AI Security Framework for Secure-by-Default Code Generation

## Version 1.1.0 (2025-04-11)

This document defines the security framework for AI models in the AI-Native Programming Paradigm, with a focus on the secure-by-default approach. It specifies the mechanisms, training approaches, and verification methods to ensure that all AI-generated code is memory-safe and properly sandboxed by default.

## 1. Overview

The AI Security Framework provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring that all code generated by AI models adheres to the secure-by-default principle. This framework transforms our security posture from an opt-in model to a mandatory approach where memory safety, sandboxing, and execution policy enforcement are the default for all generated code.

### 1.1 Core Principles

- **Security-First Generation**: AI models must generate secure code by default
- **Explicit Override Control**: Overrides require explicit justification and approval
- **Verification Integration**: Security verification is integrated into the generation pipeline
- **Explanation Transparency**: Security properties and rationale are included in explanations
- **Continuous Improvement**: Security capabilities evolve through feedback and learning

### 1.2 Framework Components

The AI Security Framework consists of four interconnected components:

- **Training Framework**: How AI models are trained to generate secure code
- **Generation Pipeline**: How security is enforced during code generation
- **Verification Integration**: How security properties are verified
- **Explanation System**: How security rationale is communicated to users

## 2. Training Framework

### 2.1 Training Data Preparation

To ensure AI models generate secure code by default, the training data must be enhanced with secure code examples:

1. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Enhance existing training data with memory-safe alternatives
   - Add examples with explicit security metadata
   - Include examples of proper sandboxing and resource constraints
   - Provide examples of security contracts and invariants

2. **Pattern Emphasis**:
   - Emphasize memory-safe coding patterns
   - Highlight proper resource management patterns
   - Showcase effective sandboxing techniques
   - Demonstrate correct error handling patterns

3. **Adversarial Examples**:
   - Include examples of common security vulnerabilities with corrections
   - Add examples of subtle memory safety issues
   - Include examples of resource exhaustion vulnerabilities
   - Provide examples of sandbox escape attempts

4. **Override Examples**:
   - Include examples of proper override justification
   - Demonstrate correct override approval workflow
   - Show examples of audit trail documentation
   - Include examples of security impact analysis for overrides

### 2.2 Model Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning strategies to reinforce secure-by-default behavior:

1. **Security-Focused Fine-Tuning**:
   - Fine-tune models on security-focused datasets

## 3. Generation Pipeline

### 3.1 Security-Aware Generation

The generation pipeline must enforce security at every step:

4. **Multi-Layer Generation**:
   - Generate consistent security properties across all three layers
   - Ensure intent layer includes security intentions

## 9. Conclusion

This AI Security Framework establishes security as a first-class concern in AI code generation, making memory safety and sandboxing the default for all generated code. By integrating security throughout the AI pipeline—from training to generation to explanation—we ensure that all code adheres to the secure-by-default approach while maintaining the flexibility needed for exceptional cases through explicit, auditable override mechanisms.

The framework is designed to evolve over time through continuous learning and improvement, allowing for the incorporation of new security features and requirements as they emerge. The migration and adoption approaches provide a clear path for updating existing AI models and supporting users in the transition to secure-by-default code generation.
