# AI Security Framework for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

This document outlines security considerations and mechanisms for the AI systems involved in the paradigm.

## Core Principles
- **Correctness as Security:** Ensuring semantic preservation (I ≈ R, R' ⊑ R, H ≈ R) is fundamental to preventing unintended and potentially harmful behavior. Verification is a core security mechanism.
- **Least Privilege:** AI components should only have the minimum capabilities necessary for their function.
- **Input Validation:** Rigorous validation of all inputs, especially human intent (I), is crucial to prevent manipulation.
- **Transparency & Auditability:** AI decisions and transformations should be logged and auditable.
- **Defense in Depth:** Employ multiple layers of security controls.

## Mechanisms & Considerations

### Input Security
- **Intent Sanitization:** Techniques to detect and neutralize malicious prompts or inputs intended to exploit the Gen phase (e.g., prompt injection, generating insecure code patterns).
- **Ambiguity Handling:** Secure protocols for clarifying user intent to prevent misunderstandings that could lead to security flaws.

### Transformation Security
- **Gen Verification (I ≈ R):** Mandatory check to ensure the AI's interpretation (R) matches the user's intent (I) without introducing vulnerabilities.
- **Opt Verification (R' ⊑ R):** Non-negotiable formal verification step for every AI-proposed optimization to guarantee correctness preservation. This prevents optimizations from introducing bugs or vulnerabilities.
- **View Verification (H ≈ R):** Checks to ensure human views (H) accurately represent R and do not mislead users into insecure actions or understandings.

### Representation Security
- **R Format Design:** The Representation (R) format should be designed with security in mind, potentially making certain vulnerability classes impossible to represent or easy to detect statically.
- **Metadata Integrity:** Securely manage and validate the metadata within R, as it guides View generation and potentially Opt decisions.

### Infrastructure Security
- **Model Security:** Protect AI models from tampering, poisoning, or unauthorized access.
- **Data Security:** Secure training data (especially pairs of I, R, H) and runtime data.
- **Sandboxing:** Execute AI components, especially those involving code execution or analysis, in sandboxed environments.
- **Access Control:** Implement strict access controls for AI systems, APIs, and memory banks.

### Operational Security
- **Monitoring & Auditing:** Continuously monitor AI behavior, log transformations and verification results, and perform regular audits.
- **Incident Response:** Plan for how to respond if a security flaw is introduced or detected in the AI-generated code or the AI system itself.
- **Ethical Guidelines:** Embed ethical constraints within the AI's operational parameters to prevent generation of harmful or biased code.

## Pipeline Integration
- Security checks (sanitization, verification) must be integrated at each stage of the I → R → R' → H → Machine Code pipeline.
- Failure in a verification step must halt the process or trigger remediation loops.
