# Verification Theory for AI-Native Programming Paradigm

## Based on Initial Formal Model (2025-04-06)

### Core Verification Goals:
1.  **Generation Correctness:** Ensure generated Representation `r` correctly implements Intent `i` (`r ⊑ i`).
2.  **Optimization Correctness:** Ensure optimization preserves semantics (`Opt(r) ≈ r`).
3.  **Viewing Faithfulness:** Ensure Human-Readable View `h` accurately reflects Representation `r` semantics (under some abstraction).

### Potential Verification Approaches:

- **Refinement Calculus:**
    - Formalize `Gen: I -> P(R)` as a refinement step.
    - Requires sufficiently formal Intent specifications (`I`).
    - Useful for linking high-level intent to low-level representation.

- **Model Checking:**
    - Applicable if machine states (`M`) and behaviors (`Obs`) are finite or finitely representable.
    - Can verify specific properties (safety, liveness) of `Sem_R(r)`.
    - Scalability challenges for complex systems.

- **Theorem Proving (Interactive/Automated):**
    - Use proof assistants (Coq, Isabelle/HOL, Lean) for rigorous proofs.
    - Particularly suited for proving optimization correctness (`Opt(r) ≈ r`).
    - Requires formal semantics for `R` and formal definitions of `Opt` transformations.
    - Can be labor-intensive.

- **Type Systems:**
    - Design advanced type systems for the Representation `R`.
    - Can statically guarantee properties (memory safety, type safety, resource bounds).
    - Can potentially encode semantic properties to aid equivalence proofs.

- **Abstract Interpretation:**
    - Develop abstract domains to soundly approximate `Sem_R`.
    - Verify property preservation (including semantic equivalence w.r.t. abstraction) for `Opt`.
    - Provides sound guarantees but may have precision limitations (false positives).

### Key Components of the Verification Framework:

- **Provably Correct Optimization Rules:** Define a library of individual optimization steps (`Opt_k`) with formal correctness proofs. `Opt` is then a composition of these.
- **Formal Equivalence Rules:** Define rules for proving `r1 ≈ r2` (e.g., based on bisimulation, trace equivalence, denotational equality).
- **Semantic Invariants:** Identify properties that must hold across `Gen` and `Opt` transformations.
- **Verification Procedures:** Define workflows combining techniques:
    1. Intent Formalization (challenging).
    2. Representation Semantics Definition (`Sem_R`).
    3. Transformation Proofs (for `Opt_k`).
    4. Generation Validation (likely requires testing/AI explanation analysis).
    5. Equivalence Checking.

### Challenges:
- Undecidability of general equivalence/refinement.
- Formalizing informal intents.
- Scalability of formal methods.
- Verifying AI components (`Gen`, potentially parts of `Opt`).

## Status:
- Initial approaches identified (2025-04-06).
- Need to select and detail specific techniques based on the chosen Representation `R`.
- Requires development of formal semantics for `R`.
