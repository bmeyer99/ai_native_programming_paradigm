# AI Capabilities Update Log

## [2025-04-11] Material Changes for Execution Model and ANRF Representation

### Summary of Changes:
- The ANRF specification and execution model now require explicit handling of:
  - Execution modes (interpretation, JIT, AOT)
  - Sandboxing and resource limits (CPU, memory, I/O)
  - Runtime policy enforcement (security, access control)
  - Execution hooks for verification and monitoring

### Required AI Capabilities:
- AI generation and transformation models must:
  - Specify and propagate execution mode, sandboxing, resource limits, and runtime policies in generated ANRF.
  - Integrate and update execution hooks for verification and monitoring as part of the workflow.
  - Reason about and preserve these properties during optimization and transformation.
  - Validate that changes to execution metadata do not violate security or correctness constraints.

### Cascade Validation Required:
- Training data and model architectures must be updated to support new metadata fields and reasoning requirements.
- Verification and explanation mechanisms must be reviewed to ensure they handle execution hooks and runtime policy changes.
- Human-AI interface and developer experience must surface and allow control/inspection of these properties.
- Tooling and CI/CD integration must support validation and enforcement of execution-related metadata.

### Next Steps:
- Flag these requirements for cascade review by:
  - Training/learning pipeline designers
  - Verification and explanation system designers
  - Developer experience and interface designers
  - Tool ecosystem engineers
